Safety and innovation work hand-in-hand in the new smartphones making their way onto the market. Facial Recognition and now fingerprint scanners are the ways we access our phones in 2018. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro were the first to introduce us to the fingerprint scanning display after much prediction by experts about a year ago about the future of smartphones. My advice about it : USE IT!!! Remember, the more we can personalise our phones access, the better for us ito safety and security. Always back it up with a password though, and keep your passwords only meaningful to you… it should not ‘make sense’ to anyone else! Stay ahead of your smartphone … because … YOUR Tech, Matters!
