JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it fully supports South African Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela, following comments she made about land on Twitter. On Friday, Mandela tweeted, "Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs." The EFF said in a statement the ambassador correctly tweeted about the need for black people to get their land back from white land thieves and racists. Responses to her comments varied, with some - including AfriForum - calling for her diplomatic recall. WATCH: Calls for Zindzi Mandela's recall following tweet backlash The red berets also reject calls from AfriForum who's deputy CEO Alana Bailey said Mandela's views are contributing “to the division of local communities”. The EFF says AfriForum is seeking to suppress a legitimate open cry by the African child that land must be returned to its rightful owners, the black people. The party added that they are pleased with the Nelson Mandela Foundation saying that that it never sought any meeting with Mandela regarding her tweets.
