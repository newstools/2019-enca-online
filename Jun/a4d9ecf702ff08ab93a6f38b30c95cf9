Four young children have been killed after the house they were in caught fire in Embo, outside Durban. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The father of four children killed in a blaze in eMbo, outside Durban says he is considering legal action against the mother. Zamani Thwala accuses her of leaving the children unsupervised when part of the house caught on fire. "I believe I have to lay charges against her because of it being irresponsible. You can't leave the children alone. You locked two doors, why? To me, it sounds like this happened on purpose to me."
