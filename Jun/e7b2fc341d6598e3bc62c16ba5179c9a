The Trust administers millions of hectares of land in the province and the King is the sole trustee. King Zwelithini and the government have previously bumped heads over how the land should be used. WATCH: King Zwelithini slapped with lawsuit over land occupiers “We are not only bringing our jackets to the table but we are bringing land, the people and new ways of doing things. I just wish for things to happen. I’ll wait for this house and the KZN government to tell us what and whom it’s bringing to the table and identify a venue for this because time is running out.” KZN premier, Sihle Zikalala says the two should work together to the benefit of the province. READ: I warned Mr Ramaphosa: King Goodwill Zwelithini “We will come together as government, traditional leaders, the Ingonyama Trust and the King to look at ways of how we are going to develop KwaZulu-Natal.” The King believes the priority should be to guarantee food security in the country.
