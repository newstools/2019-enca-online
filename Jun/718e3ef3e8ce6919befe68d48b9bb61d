Council’s senior manager Danie Marais says children living with disabilities are falling through the cracks in the Children’s Act. READ: 600,000 disabled SA children have never been to school "The Children's Act is there to protect the rights of children and then also children with disabilities but unfortunately that does not get enforced and it is not enough", said Marais. Marais says there is no dedicated ministerial strategy in place to ensure the protection of children with disabilities. "Access to the schooling system for children with disabilities. The government is promoting an inclusive environment for schools mainstream but the reality is that a majority of schools are not accessible for children with physical disabilities and then also if you get into the classroom environment, the teachers are not equipped on how to cope and teach children with disabilities."
