JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) will be meeting with Mozambican officials after a shooting along the border. Local soldiers and Mozambican border police were involved in the incident. It took place at Ndumo in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. It's not clear what led to the incident, but a team has been sent to probe the shooting. Unconfirmed reports say between two and five people may have been killed. AFP reported that Mozambican officials said the incident occurred in the Ponta de Ouro region, but gave few details. READ: SANDF: Inquiry to investigate Mozambique border shooting "The Defence and Security Forces, particularly the police of the Republic of Mozambique, are working to understand what actually motivated the incident," Foreign Minister Jose Pacheco told reporters in the capital Maputo. After gaining more information, the government will seek clarification from the South African side, "always preserving the relations of friendship between the two countries", he said. SANDF spokesperson Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi said a board of inquiry will be convened to determine causes of the incident. "It would be difficult to say what really happened. A team was sent to Ndumo to investigate the incident," said Mgobozi. "As South Africa and Mozambique we enjoy a fruitful relationship and our troops patrolling the borders have a relationship with the Mozambican border police." - Additional reporting AFP
