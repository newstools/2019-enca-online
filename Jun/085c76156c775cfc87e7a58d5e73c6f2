Earlier on Friday, the lions were spotted roaming around the Foskor phosphate mine. JUST IN: 14 lions on the loose in Limpopo SANParks released a statement, saying the lions are not part of a known pride from the Kruger National Park or adjacent private nature reserves. "It has been reported that this pride has been residing for more than a year within the Foskor, Phalaborwa Mining Company and direct adjacent areas, moving along the Selati river system," read the statement. It said the pride might have established in this area due to the current availability of prey in these areas, and due to a lack of competition from other lion prides. KNP GM: Conservation Dr Marisa Coetzee said in a meeting between various parties it was agreed that a capture operation to be coordinated by Limpopo Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (LEDET) will be carried out as per the approved protocols. LEDET is the responsible authority on this matter. “The plan is to capture the pride and move them to a suitable area outside of the KNP and private reserves, where after they will be closely monitored by LEDET.” - Additional reporting AFP
