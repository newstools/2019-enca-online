South Africa's David Miller drops a catch off the batting of India's Rohit Sharma during the 2019 Cricket World Cup group stage match between South Africa and India. LONDON - India launched their World Cup campaign with a win over South Africa. Injury-hit South Africa won the toss and elected to bat first. The Proteas set up a target of 228. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal was the pick of the bowlers as India restricted South Africa to 227 for 9. Chahal returned figures of four for 51 to rip the heart out of the South African batting line-up, to the delight of a large contingent of Indian fans. Chris Morris, batting at number eight, provided late resistance with his fighting 42 during an eighth-wicket partnership of 66 with Kagiso Rabada, who made an unbeaten 31 -- his highest one-day international total. In the second innings, wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock took a sensational catch to remove India's Virat Kohli for 18. De Kock was airborne as he flew towards first slip to grab the ball, which flew off Kohli's edge from a rising delivery by paceman Andile Phehlukwayo. It is the first time that Kohli has not started the World Cup with a century after reaching triple figures in his first matches of the 2011 and 2015 editions.
