The Eskom Pension and Provident Fund's CIO says it's in strong health and well governed. JOHANNESBURG - The Eskom Pension and Provident Fund's CIO says it's in strong health and well governed. Ndabe Mkhize says the fund can meet all its liabilities, but it can't bail out Eskom. He says the EPPF is regulated by the Pension Fund Act and all its decisions have to be in its members' interest.

"We would continue to do what is good for our members and pensioners." As it stands, Eskom's debt is at R420-billion and it could balloon to around R500-billion soon. READ: Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe steps down With an asset value of R147-billion, the EPPF has been at pains to explain it’s a separate legal entity from Eskom. But should the embattled power utility come cap-in-hand to South Africa’s largest private pension fund, would it be in a position to give Eskom a bailout? “According to regulation it can only be up to five percent, but those would be independent decisions taken in the interest of our members," said Mkhize. "I don’t want to give an indication that we would be increasing that.” Sixty percent of the EPPF’s assets are managed locally, two-thirds of which by black asset managers.
