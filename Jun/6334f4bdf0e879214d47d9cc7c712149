Management's confirmed that the mining hospital isn't paying pensions and SARS contributions either despite the deductions reflecting on their payslips
Workers are crying fraud while the hospital says the situation isn't a secret.

"The only thing with them is that when they go into their systems they cannot see our hospital" Phodiso Clinics took over the West Vaal Hospital in October last year.

Head of Technical Operations at West Vaal, Piet Gouws said, "JMCA was supposed to do all the finances and funding, and six weeks after this project was taken over, JMCA just disappeared." "They completely disappeared off the map, nobody knows where they are. and they left Phodi Clinics in a very bad financial predicament" Union representatives are fuming. Vuyisani Lengesi, NUM North West representative said, "the government and Cosatu in this province must intervene in this problem because we are sick and tired with fly-by-night companies who don't want to pay the employees while the employees are wake up in daily basis, come at work but at the end of the day, they get nothing." While the employees are demanding their salaries for the last four months, the owner's licence to operate the hospital expires at the end of this month.
