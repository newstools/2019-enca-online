Modise is hoping to keep the budget at just over R1-million. President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to deliver his speech in two weeks' time. READ:Â Ramaphosa's 2019 Sona in quotes "For me, it's important that South Africans feel that their public representatives really talk about them and their issues and interfere on their behalf," said Modise. Rather than spending money on lavish events, Modise wants to use her budget to improve the work of Parliament, and the public's role in it.
