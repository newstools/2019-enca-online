Kriel, who is currently recovering from an ankle injury, is a strong contender to wear the number 13 jersey for the Springboks at the World Cup after putting in some scintillating performances for the Bulls in Super Rugby this year.

Since then the Gwijo Squad -- which is made up of professionals and students -- have gone on to add their voice at venues such as the Wanderers Stadium in support of the Proteas. The group sings traditional Xhosa songs and have again promised to throw their support behind the Springboks in their Rugby Championship matches against Australia and Argentina at Ellis Park and Loftus Versfeld next month and all the way to the World Cup in Japan.
