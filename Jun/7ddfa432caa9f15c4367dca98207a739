More than 200 workers finally surfaced Thursday after Lanxess Chrome Mine in Rustenburg granted their demands. The 9 days underground were challenging in many ways but miners said they prevailed. READ: Lanxess mine strike called off “It wasn’t nice down there. Our sleeping place was unbearable. We slept on top of rocks, covering ourselves with plastics, in the cold weather. It was difficult but through the grace of the Lord we managed to reach our goal,” said one miner. Mine management has expressed happiness that the situation is finally resolved.
