JOHANNESBURG - Car boots filled with cash, strong arm tactics used to push through deals favouring the Gupta brothers. That'sÂ just some of the allegations that emerged at the State Capture inquiry last week. Former Transnet executives testified of rampant corruption under former CEO Brian Molefe and former CFO Anoj Singh. WATCH: State capture inquiry adjourned On Monday, another former Transnet employee is expected to testify at the Zondo Commission. The inquiry will also hear from the head of the Reserve Bank's financial surveillance unit, Elijah Mazibuko, about irregular foreign exchange transactions linked to a Gupta-owned company, Homix. According to Mazibuko, the company's accounts bore the hallmarks of a money laundering scheme.
