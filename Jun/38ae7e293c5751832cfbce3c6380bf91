eNCA speaks to Nico de Jager, the MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - No need to panic. That's the word from the City of Johannesburg ahead of next week's Rand Water shutdown. MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services in Johannesburg Nico de Jager, says residents should have enough water to use over the 54-hour period if people start using water sparingly now. WATCH: Water cuts imminent without electricity: Rand Water Rand Water needs to install a valve on the main pipeline. To do this, it will shut the flow to reservoirs. But water already in reservoirs will continue to flow to residents. The company also advised residents to regularly check their load-shedding schedule for their areas on the City Power and Eskom websites as load-shedding affects the water supply. There might not be water in some areas and water could be running low in others.
