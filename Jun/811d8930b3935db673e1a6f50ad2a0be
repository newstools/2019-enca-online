Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom's unbundling into three units will go ahead as planned. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said a final plan for the split is progressing well. WATCH: Unions up in arms over Eskom unbundling The plan has been criticised because of its delayed implementation. “Good progress has been made in relation to working out a road map to implement the proposals in the February 2019 Sona to separate generation, transmission and distribution functions into three separate business entities wholly owned by the state. There is no deviation from this strategic path,” said Gordhan.
