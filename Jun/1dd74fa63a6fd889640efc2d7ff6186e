Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The US is now requesting “most” visa applicants to provide information about their social media accounts. Plans requiring US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information were announced in March last year. This is expected to affect around 15-million people. WATCH: New visa policy announced Sarah Hoffman, a Social Media Law Expert from the Digital Law Company said there were a number of concerns with these requirements. “They are asking for a list of your social media accounts, phone numbers of over the past years and email addresses...the email addresses is kind of a strange one. There is a degree of what exactly it is all going to be used for.” “This is, of course, is met with a lot of trepidation by people who think this new policy is going to be used in a discriminatory way. For example, if I am Muslim and I post content about my religion or belief system on my social media accounts, which I am perfectly entitled to do, is that then going to be used against me in my visa application,” she added.
