Groundstaff prepare the pitch for ICC Cricket World Cup match between India and New Zealand at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Britain on 13 June 2019. NOTTINGHAM - Inclement English weather claimed yet another World Cup match after India's group game against 2015 finalists New Zealand was called off without a ball being bowled at Trent Bridge on Thursday. A soggy outfield from overnight showers had already delayed the start of the contest between the tournament's only two unbeaten side.

New Zealand top the table with seven points, two ahead of India who have played one game fewer.
