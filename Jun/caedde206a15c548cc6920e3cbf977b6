West Indies' Sheldon Cottrell (L) celebrates taking the wicket of South Africa's Hashim Amla (R). SOUTHAMPTON - The World Cup match between South Africa and the West Indies was abandoned on Monday after persistent heavy rain in Southampton, with both sides earning a point each. Earlier, West Indies paceman Sheldon Cottrell reduced Faf du Plessis's team to 29 for two before rain stopped play. South Africa, desperately needing a win after defeats in their first three matches of the tournament in England and Wales, lost the toss and were put in to bat under threatening skies. They were quickly in trouble, with Hashim Amla edging Cottrell to Chris Gayle at slip for just six, sparking the bowler's trademark celebration featuring a short march and salute. That brought Aiden Markram to the wicket but he had only made five when he tickled a Cottrell delivery down the legside and wicketkeeper Shai Hope completed the catch to leave South Africa in deep trouble at 28-2 in the seventh over. In the following over, delivered by Oshane Thomas, rain stopped play and the covers came on. The West Indies are fifth in the World Cup table with three points after three matches, while South Africa are second from bottom after four games, leaving their hopes of making the semi-finals hanging by a thread.
