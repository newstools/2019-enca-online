Phodi Clinics CEO Doctor Nkaki Matlala, and the hospital's HR director Ndileka Nobaxa give their response to the controversy. Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - More than 70 workers at the West Vaal Hospital have not received salaries for four months. Phodiso Clinics took over the West Vaal Hospital in October last year and employees say the company is not registered with SARS or the pension fund. The employees say although they get payslips every month which reflect all the deductions they still do not receive their salaries. Ndileka Nobaxa, the hospitals HR director, confirmed that the company has been making the deductions but insists that these are book entries which will be used in future. READ: West Vaal Hospital employees unpaid for four months "We have been making those deductions but it is important to note that these are book entries and we need to go back where the problem." "Book entries mean that when the time comes to pay the employees, when the funds become available then we are going to be able to reconcile all those and pay the necessary third party payments and the employees", said Nobaxa. Dr Nkaki Matlala from Phodiso Clinics is shifting the blame onto JM Capital Africa which was supposed to be in charge of payments.
"We agreed to form a joint venture with them where our role was going to be management of the hospital and their role was going to be financing of the hospital." While the employees are demanding their salaries for the last four months the owner's licence to operate the hospital expires at the end of this month.
