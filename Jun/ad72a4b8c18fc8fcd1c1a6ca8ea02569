The union said the government has constantly failed to secure educators in schools. READ: Teacher gunned down at Durban school The call comes after a KwaZulu-Natal educator was shot dead on Tuesday morning at Masuku Primary School in Folweni, south of Durban. The union's secretary general Siphiwe Mpungose refused to soften the statement and said teachers must not go to schools empty-handed because people have not responded to teachers' safety concerns.

Meanwhile, the National Association of School Governing Bodies' secretary-general Matakanye Matakanya said schools are gun-free zones and while the body sympathised with the union's concerns, they could not advocate for more violence. Matakanya said schools cannot become chaotic zones of face-offs between students and teachers.
