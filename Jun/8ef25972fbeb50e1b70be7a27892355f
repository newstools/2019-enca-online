JOHANNESBURG - The State Capture Inquiry continues on Monday. It will hear evidence from the Director of Asset Movement Financial Services, Kalandra Viljoen.
Head of fuel management at SAA, Mark Vaughan, will also testify. Last week, former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo was implicated. Businesswoman Babadi Tlatsana claimed her company, Koroneka, and others were used to siphon off millions of rand. She said it was "hijacked" by Brian van Wyk of SA Express. Koroneka was allegedly paid to do ground handling at two North West airports. It received R8.5-million before completing even a month's work.
