Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Royal Moroccan Athletics Federation says Caster Semenya declined an invite to race in the country. Semenya is disputing the allegations, saying she was prepared for the trip. Greg Nott said the reasons Semenya did not attend the Diamond League meeting in Rabat was because of the logistic of her getting to Morocco.

So it was completely not in her favour to do so,” said Nott. Semenya on Friday was cleared to compete in the 800 meters event in Rabat, Morocco on Sunday. Morocco initially barred Semenya from running in the event. The Swiss Supreme Court ruled that the can compete until her appeal against the IAAF gender rules is decided.
