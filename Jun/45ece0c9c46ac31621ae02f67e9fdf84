The international festival is taking place on the African continent for the very first time this year. Over 4,000 people are expected to roam the festival grounds with cups of free coffee. Artisan roasters are using the opportunity to get people to explore the vast range of blends available in their shops and cafes. There are still tickets available online or at the door for coffee aficionados and novices alike before the festival closes on Sunday night.
