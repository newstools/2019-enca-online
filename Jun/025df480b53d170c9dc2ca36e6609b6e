The 18-year-old para-athlete represents South Africa in wheelchair basketball and athletics. She dreams of representing the country in Switzerland but needs funding to do so. JOHANNESBURG - Para-athlete Nokuthula Yonke dreams of representing South Africa abroad. The 18-year-old woman was born with Spina bifida, and after some health issues, had to have her right leg amputated. "My whole life changed. I never thought that I would ever play for South Africa. Sometimes, yes, I felt like giving up. I thought to myself 'I’m done with this whole thing' and then I always had motivation behind my back, support from family, coach.” She went on to get involved in a number of sports, including wheelchair basketball, javelin and shotput. Yonke has been selected to be part of Team SA at the World Para Athletic Junior Championships in Switzerland. It's a dream come true for her, but could also be a nightmare if she doesn’t raise the funds to pay her way. * Watch Justin Ford's story above.
