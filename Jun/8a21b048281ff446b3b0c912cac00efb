To discuss this further, attorney Natasha Moni joins us now. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - A medical certificate may not be enough to convince your employer of illness. Companies can request further information from your doctor if the sick note is for a Monday, Friday or a day after a public holiday.

If you abuse it more than a couple of days in an 8-week cycle, then the company is entitled to say that you need to explain this sick leave", said Natasha Moni, an attorney. Moni said that if a company suspects abuse they can summon a medical practitioner who will then be required to write an affidavit or even be called in for questioning. "Do not abuse sick leave. A company can place you under disciplinary inquiry for submitting fraudulent medical certificates and they won't pay you", she added.

"That is for a father who is not taking maternity leave and it is ten days. The perimeters around that are that you need to apply a month before the birth of your child and that the child should be registered under your name" Moni said.
