Courtesy #DStv403 WITBANK - The Mpumalanga woman who allegedly murdered her children with rat poison could use extreme anger as a valid defence, says her lawyer. Zinhle Maditla (25) is facing four counts of premeditated murder. A psychiatric evaluation by the State deemed her fit to stand trial.

He says his client will need to consult with independent experts to determine a possible defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity. This means while Maditla may have been sane when she committed the crime, she could have been suffering from an emotional disturbance that eliminates criminal liability. But the State argues no exceptional circumstances warranting bail were presented.

The prosecutor's added that she tried to take her own life and may try to do so again -- which is an attempt to evade trial. The State says Maditla is unemployed and her release on bail would be a financial burden on her family. The court is expected to rule on her bail application next week.
