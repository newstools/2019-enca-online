The heatwave -- India's second-longest on record -- prompted authorities in part of the northern state, one of the country's poorest, to impose curfew-like restrictions. PATNA - The Indian state of Bihar grappled with twin crises, with a brain virus potentially linked to lychees killing almost 100 children and extreme heat leaving 78 people dead. The heatwave -- India's second-longest on record -- prompted authorities in part of the northern state, one of the country's poorest, to impose curfew-like restrictions. Daytime temperatures across large parts of India have hovered above 40 degrees Celsius for the past 32 days, just one short of a record 33-day period in 1988. Severe heat there has killed 78 people -- most of them aged above 50 -- across three districts since Saturday afternoon, local official Sandeep Kumar told AFP. More than 130 others were undergoing emergency treatment for heatstroke in various hospitals.

Bihar, home to some of India's worst health indicators, has also been struggling with an outbreak of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), a viral infection, since the start of this month. Eighty children have now died in the state's biggest government-run hospital -- the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), in the city of Muzaffarpur -- and 17 others at a private facility, health official Ashok Kumar Singh said. Most of the victims had suffered a sudden loss of glucose in their blood, Singh told AFP. TV channels showed distraught parents sitting next to their children, several of whom were cramped on one bed. The outbreak of the disease has happened annually during summer months in the same districts since 1995, typically coinciding with the lychee season.
