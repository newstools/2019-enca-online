Government leaders must never lie to the public, so says former president Kgalema Motlanthe. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Former president Kgalema Motlanthe is warning public representatives that their actions will be subject to public opinion at all times. Motlanthe is advising those holding office that they should always be guided by ethics and the rule of law. "When we speak of integrity, we mean what do people think of you,” said Motlanthe who was speaking at the induction of the new Gauteng MECs at Liliesleaf in Rivonia. “How do they assess you and, do they hold you in high esteem or do they use you as an example of malfeasance and wrongdoing?"

"But if you're a liar, if you're a liar, even your children, your son would be on the podium and people will ask, whose son is he and they will say it's Kgalema's son,' and they will say ooooh he's finished us, we're finished," Motlanthe said.

Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he doesn't want to see any of his MECs implicated in wrongdoing - such as State Capture.
