The Democratic Alliance has asked Parliament to initiate proceedings for her removal. The organisation 'Hands off our public protector' is adamant that Mkhwebane is a competent public protector and she should finish her term in office. READ: Mkhwebane yet to decide on Ramaphosa's request Spokesperson for the organisation Thabo Mtsweni says Mkhwebane needs to be protected. "I think it is very important that we must note that the public protector is an institution of democracy that was created and gets its power from the constitution, so it is very important to protect her from all the propaganda that is going on at the moment", said Mtsweni. Mtsweni says although some of her reports have been set aside, a majority of her reports are credible. "She issued 100 reports, only two of those have been set aside in court, so it is not reason enough."
