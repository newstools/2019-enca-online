JOHANNESBURG - The Centre for Child Law says children should not be dealt with more harshly than adults when being caught using cannabis. The organisation is asking the South Gauteng High Court to reconsider prosecuting children caught smoking cannabis Last year, the Constitutional Court made it legal for adults to cultivate and consume marijuana in the privacy of their own homes. "We are not saying that the smoking of marijuana by minors should be decriminalised...that's not what we are saying. This case is an automatic review of criminal proceedings that were brought against children in the Child Justice Court", said Centre for Child Law attorney, Lithalethemba Stwayi.

"Should a child be found drunk at school then the substance abuse act comes into play. You also have to check what the circumstances are...what is the reason behind this and you can actually take them [children] to rehab", she said. "At the moment we have a gap in how to deal with children." #DaggaJudgement Post-judgme... by on Scribd
