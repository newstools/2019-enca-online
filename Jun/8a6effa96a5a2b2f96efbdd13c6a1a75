Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says the current university curriculum doesn’t prepare young people adequately. JOHANNESBURG - As the challenges of the 4th Industrial Revolution keep growing, some young people are venting their frustrations of not having the skills needed for the future. Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says the current university curriculum doesn’t prepare young people adequately. He says there’s an urgent need for the education system to become more relevant.

But the former statesman believes it’s not all doom and gloom. “4th industrial revolution means is that productivity will shoot up with fewer human beings involved in production and that will leave a whole section of the population with lots of leisure time in their hands. So we should think of what are they going to do with all these time,” said Motlanthe. But some young people are not so optimistic about their futures.

Motlanthe says there’s a clear need to do things differently. "The university curriculum has got to be revised to be more relevant and practical. University got to prepare young people to meet the demands of the current economic system," he said. The former stateman's Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation is spearheading artificial intelligence education in the townships. He says while jobs as we know them will be fewer, this means people will be inspired to become more creative.
