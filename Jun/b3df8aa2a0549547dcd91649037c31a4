At no stage did I attempt to interfere with the Commission’s work or the work conducted by Advocate [Jannie] Lubbe,” More said. She's told the inquiry staff members approached her for assistance with legal costs associated with appearing at the inquiry. More's also told the commission the continued rotation of finances ministers impacted the role of executives at the PIC. She will continue her testimony on Tuesday.
