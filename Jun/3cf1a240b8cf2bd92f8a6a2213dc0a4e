There were colourful scenes in downtown Durban on Saturday as members of the city's LGBTQI community marched to highlight equal rights and dignity. DURBAN - Durban was painted red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple on Saturday, as the LGBTQI community took to the streets in this year's Pride celebration. Those who attended, called on people to keep the promise of equal rights and dignity. The parade was part of the ninth edition of Durban Pride, which celebrates sexual diversity. “Durban Pride for us is the culmination of a human rights campaign that lasts the whole year. So it’s a space where normally we educate each other about our human rights, what do they mean, how do we claim them. And of course Pride becomes a place where we can symbolise that,” said Pride Director Nonhlanhla Mkhize.
