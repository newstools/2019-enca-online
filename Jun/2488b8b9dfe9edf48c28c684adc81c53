The court is set to hand down judgment in the matter of the General Council of The Bar application to have them struck from the role of advocates. READ: Jiba, Mrwebi fired The Bar initially succeeded in its application before the High Court in Pretoria. The axed advocates then took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). After being sacked by President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this year from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Jiba and Mrwebi are fighting to keep their professional status as advocates.
