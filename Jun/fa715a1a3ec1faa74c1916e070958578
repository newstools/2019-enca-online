Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The EFF claims the Red Ants target poor black people. It says the eviction company's contract with government should be reviewed. This after a Red Ants demolition in Alexandra last week left hundreds homeless. READ: Red Ants bite back over Alex demolitions The EFF's Gauteng chairperson Mandisa Mashego is testifying before the Alexandra inquiry. Mashego told the inquiry the demolition was illegal and inhumane. She said she was contacted by residents and followed up with Councillor and MMC for Public Safety in the City of Johannesburg Michael Sun to find out whether he knew the people present. WATCH: EFF testifies at Alexandra inquiry Sun said he was unaware and an urgent investigation was underway,” she explained. “I never got to meet the most senior officer to see the official eviction court order,” she testified. READ: 'Where is the Alexandra renewal money?' Malema asks The EFF stated they have a database compiled with the community of the structures demolished and deny that the homes were unoccupied. The City of Joburg's forensic head Shadrack Sibiya continued his testimony in camera. Media and the public have been excluded from this last testimony on Thursday as it's expected to implicate high-profile individuals.
