The Golden State Warriors have forced a Game 6 as they defeated the Toronto Raptors by a final score of 106-105. CANADA -Â Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Klay Thompson added 26 as the defending champion Golden State Warriors edged Toronto 106-105 Monday to sustain their hopes of winning the NBA Finals. The Warriors pulled within 3-2 in the best-of-seven championship series and forced a sixth game on Thursday at Oakland, California, with game seven if needed back in Toronto on Sunday. On a night when Warriors star Kevin Durant returned from a right calf injury but played only 12 minutes before going out with another lower right leg injury, Golden State barely denied the Raptors their first NBA crown. READ: Durant's return for Warriors in NBA Finals was a short one Kawhi Leonard, who led Toronto with 26 points, sank a back-to-back 3-pointer and jumper to give the Raptors their largest lead at 103-97 with 3:28 remaining. But the Warriors answered with Thompson and Curry sinking 3-pointers and Thompson hitting another to put Golden State ahead to stay at 106-103 with 57 seconds to play. Kyle Lowry cut the lead to the final margin with 30 seconds remaining and the Warriors made a final turnover when DeMarcus Cousins was whistled for a foul while trying to set a screen. That gave Toronto a last chance but the Warriors double-teamed Leonard and Lowry missed a corner 3-point shot at the buzzer. "Do or die," Curry said. "It wasn't pretty in the second half but we just made the shots."
