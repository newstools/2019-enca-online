MultiChoice has just confirmed it's beginning a consultation process, with its employees regarding possible retrenchments. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - MultiChoice has confirmed that it will enter into a 60-day consultation process with 2194 of its employees regarding possible retrenchments. MultiChoice says fewer customers are using the call-in and walk-in centres. CEO Calvo Mawela also cited increased competition from additional players in the industry and unregulated OTT platforms. “This has not been an easy decision to make but, in a business driven by advancing technologies, we must continue to drive efficiencies yet be agile enough to adapt to evolving customer needs to ensure that we remain relevant, competitive and sustainable,” Mawela said. “We must act decisively to align to the change in customer behaviour and competition from OTT services because if we don’t reposition now, we run the risk of being completely misaligned and we put everyone’s jobs at risk.” READ: Steinhoff announces R20bn loss The company says more people are using self-service and digital technologies to interact with the company.
