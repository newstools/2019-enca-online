Police and the ANC say it’s too early to speculate whether the incident could be politically-motivated or not. READ: Another ANCYL leader gunned down in KZN Maxwell Hadebe died in a hail of bullets outside the tavern he owned. The incident happened in full view of revellers who had to run for cover. WATCH: More than 120 arrested in KZN political killings “The motive is unknown at the moment but that is subject to investigation. We are informed that he was just there in the tavern and came out of the counter towards the door and suddenly unknown men approached him fired gunshots towards him without uttering a word,” said KZN police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbhele. KwaZulu-Natal has been plagued by political killings but the ANC is wary of saying this latest murder is one of them. “When you have a member of the African National Congress being killed, it is a worry. But it is a worry more so in the province of KwaZulu-Natal because we have had so many comrades killed and this point it is not clear what is leading to the killings. Now, whether a comrade is a leader or not the fact that it’s a member of the African National Congress that is being killed is a matter that is of serious worry to us. We hope that the task team that we have in the province will also intervene and quickly get to the investigation of the matter so that we get to the finality of it,” said ANC KZN spokesperson, Nomagugu Simelane Zulu. Hadebe’s family couldn't be reached for comment.
