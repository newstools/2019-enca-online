Fraser alleges Pauw defamed him in the book, The President's Keepers. Fraser's summons describes the book as "a piece of propaganda" that paints certain politicians and other people as corrupt. He says the resultant reputational damage led to the closure of Resurgent Risk Managers, a company in which he had an interest. Pauw says he welcomes the opportunity to go to court and has waited for over 18 months since the book’s release. “Arthur Fraser will be the first spy boss or ex-spy boss to appear in court, he will probably testify and we will cross-examine him,” Pauw said. “In the run-up to the case we will apply to discover all the documents of his company to see who he got contracts from, we will apply to discover documents from the State Security Agency and if they refuse to give it to us we will launch an urgent court application.” Arthur Fraser says the resultant reputational damage led to the closure of Resurgent Risk Managers, a company in which he had an interest. Courtesy #DStv403 Fraser’s lawyer Rapulane Kgoroeadira says they are confident the court will rule in their favour. He has rubbished Pauw’s claims that the legal proceedings against him are scare tactics. “If he feels scared then that is his problem and not ours,” Kgoroeadira said.
