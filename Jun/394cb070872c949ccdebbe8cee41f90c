Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald's, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. NEW YORK - Uber said it would begin testing food delivery by drone as it ramps up its Uber Eats service that partners with restaurants. The ride-hailing giant announced at its Uber Elevate Summit that it had been given regulatory approval to begin tests of delivering food by drone in the region of San Diego, California. "Our goal is to expand Uber Eats drone delivery so we can provide more options to more people at the tap of a button," said Luke Fischer, head of flight operations at Uber Elevate.

For logistical reasons, the drones will not deliver directly to customers, but to a safe drop-off location where an Uber Eats driver will complete the order. In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand.

While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States. Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald's, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year.
