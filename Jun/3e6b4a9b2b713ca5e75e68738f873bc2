READ: District Six land claimants still optimistic The District Six museum is fighting for the area to return to its original name. The district was destroyed by the apartheid government during forced removals.
Noor Ebrahim explained what the name means to him, "Zonnebloem means nothing to me not only to me but to the whole community of District Six to us it will always be District Six."
"To us, it was always District Six it was never Zonnebloem, we never used the name Zonnebloem. So officially if they do it, we'll be very happy for the name of District Six it was very important for us," Ebrahim said. The community says there are sentimental, historic and other reasons the name should be reinstated. Courtesy of #DSTV403 The museum's director says the removals were an attack on the dignity of its residents. READ: District Six land claimants want answers Bonita Bennett, the District Six museum director said, "I think for former residents of District Six, they are very very clear that when their homes were destroyed, their streets destroyed, their lives ripped apart the renaming and taking away the name of District Six and naming it Zonnebloem was an act of oppression and an act of annihilation of their identity." "That's why it's very important to have this area renamed to District Six and not Zonnebloem." "It also links to the museum's desire of a community. We're following the steps because people haven't ever called it Zonnebloem really it's always been District Six to them but on the map and on official documents it is Zonnebloem."
