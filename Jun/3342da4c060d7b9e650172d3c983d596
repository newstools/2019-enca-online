Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Film and Television star Mmabatho Montsho is exploring new avenues as she directs her first theatre production Frontières. The production is a collection of testimonies African migrants living in South Africa. "I think first and foremost, the exciting thing was that this was told from the migrants' point of view and not from a saviours point of view or not from a South African perspective." Market Theatre photographs misleading: spokesperson "These are verbatim, it's verbatim theater, so it is word for word the testimonies that people delivered and the actors are just delivering what was said word for word", said Montsho. Montsho says the play also deals with the misconceptions around how migrants end up living in South Africa. "Most people are forced migrants, they are forced to leave their families at home because of varying circumstances such as wars." The play is on at the Market Theater in Johannesburg until 7 July.
