Adam Catzavelos apologises, but it seems his legal troubles are just beginning. JOHANNESBURG - Ashamed and sorry. That’s the word from Adam Catzavelos, who appeared in court after using the K-word. He’s facing a crimen injuria charge after sharing his racist outburst on social media while on holiday on a Greek Island. This matter has been postponed to next month, but Catzavelos is also facing charges in Greece.

"I express my sympathy and sorrow to anyone upset.” The State believes it has a solid case against Catzavelos, despite the fact that the video in which he uses the k-word was recorded and sent out in Greece. READ: Lawyer: 'Catzavelos also faces prosecution in Greece' But his legal team disagrees. They will be making representations to the director of Public Prosecutions in Gauteng in the hopes of reviewing the decision to go ahead with the case. While the matter is expected back in court on 10 July, it’s understood that he could also be facing prosecution in Greece.
