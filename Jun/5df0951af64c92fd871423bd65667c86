Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The Arms Deal saga continues 20-years after the fact, this time in the North Gauteng High Court. Corruption Watch and Right 2 Know want the court to review and set aside the findings of the Seriti Inquiry. The organisations are arguing that the commission misled the public and ignored evidence of corruption. WATCH: State to put forward case at Zuma trial The court application comes more than three years after Judge Willie Seriti, who headed the arms procurement commission inquiry, exonerated politicians of any acts of wrongdoing. The commission was set up in 2011 by then Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Jeff Radebe. It was at the behest of former president Jacob Zuma. It was set up to look into allegations of fraud, corruption, impropriety or irregularity in the Strategic Defence Procurement Packages, commonly known as the Arms Deal.
