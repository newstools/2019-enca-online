Two free-roaming elephants from the Eastern Cape have been relocated to a small barren enclosure in Joburg Zoo. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Zoo says it has complied with all the necessary requirements to move two elephants into the facility. The National Council of SPCA has condemned the move and said the captive environment is 'detrimental' to the elephant's well-being. "In spite of our legal communications to the Johannesburg Zoo, and enquiries with the permitting official, Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (GDARD), two elephants were relocated to the Johannesburg Zoo on 12 June 2019," read the statement from the organisation. Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo spokesperson Jenny Moodley said the views expressed by the NSPCA are unfortunate, especially since the organisation was notified about the intentions to move the elephants.

Moodley said the elephants are not from the wild and are from a captive environment, which is in compliance with regulations. The NSPCA has vowed to continue to explore their legal options. MMC For Community Development Nonhlanhla Sifumba said they are ecstatic that Lammie has been joined by two elephants.

"They decided to actually move themselves away from the ethics committee on 14 January," said Sifumba. "We tried our best to engage with them. The notion that the zoo did not follow proper procedure is unwarranted." Two free-roaming elephants from the Eastern Cape have been relocated to a small barren enclosure in Joburg Zoo.
