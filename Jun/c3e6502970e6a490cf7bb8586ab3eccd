File: Double Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won the 2000-metres race at the Montreuil athletics in Paris on Tuesday. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's star athlete Caster Semenya has taken a jab at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Speaking after her 2,000m win at the Meeting de Montreuil in Paris on Tuesday, Semenya said the IAAF should focus on doping instead of fighting to restrict testosterone levels in female runners.

"I can run any event I want, it can be 100 metres, it can be 200 metres... you name it, I'm a talented athlete. So I'm not worried about anything else even if I have to withdraw from 800 metres, It doesn't matter no more," she said. "I think I have won everything I have ever wanted. So, I'm not an idiot! Why would I take any drugs? I'm a pure athlete, I don't cheat. They should focus on doping than us," she said. READ: IAAF to fight Semenya's Swiss court testosterone ruling Semenya was competing in her first race since filing an appeal against the IAAF's ruling to restrict testosterone levels in female runners. The IAAF ruling means she may have to change from her favoured 800m discipline. The Court of Sport Arbitration rejected Semenya's appeal against the ruling. However, she appealed to the Swiss federal supreme court which temporarily suspended the IAAF's rules last week until a further hearing can take place.
