A serial killer may be targeting Pretoria's homeless. PRETORIA - Police are investigating the murders of three homeless men in Pretoria in the past two weeks. There have been suggestions the attacks could have been committed by a serial killer after the victims were killed in the same manner. A manhunt is under way. Intelligence units and informers are being used to help solve the crimes. The bodies of two homeless middle-aged men were found in the park in the leafy suburb of Muckleneuk. The body of a third man was found about 500 metres from the park two weeks ago. Police have increased visibility at the park and surrounding areas. They're also warning the homeless to be more vigilant. A homeless advocacy group is convinced the men are being specifically targeted.
