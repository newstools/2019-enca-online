WATCH: Mail & Guardian 200 Young South Africans 2019 After a cycling accident left her paralysed, Manaleng committed her time to train to compete in the Paralympics. "I came to realise that life is truly short. I had to make a choice of either thinking there is always tomorrow or living every moment like it was the last one on earth. And so I began pursuing every goal and dream with voice at the back of my head reminding me that tomorrow is not guaranteed". eNCA Online Editor Lynne O'Connor praised Manaleng for her passion and commitment to her sport. "I have truly never met another human being who is so positive, so passionate about life in general. Palesa came back from a crushing injury, determined to shine. She's an example to us all." Checkpoint producer Kyla Herrmannsen was honoured for her contribution to the field of investigative journalism. Herrmannsen produced several documentaries on the human rights abuses of mental health patients in the Life Esidimeni case. Her exposure of the government's decision-making was used as evidence by the Health Ombudsman to inform his findings and recommendations, earning her two Discovery health journalism awards. Checkpoint Executive Producer, Nkepile Mabuse said of Hermannsen, "Kyla is one of the most credible, thorough, dedicated, intelligent, resourceful and hardworking journalists I have ever had the pleasure of working with." "She truly cares about the people in her stories, hates injustice and is driven by her passion to make a difference. She is an incredible asset to Checkpoint. I have absolutely no doubt that she’s destined for even greater things in the future."
