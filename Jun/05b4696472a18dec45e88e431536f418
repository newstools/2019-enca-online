Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A fellow student at Goldfields TVET College in Welkom has said that the alleged suspect shouldn't receive bail following Naledi Lethoba's murder. Last week, Welkom police officials discovered Naledi's body in an open field in a "shocking state" with her breasts cut off and a knife stuck in her neck. "What happened to her was bad and it affected most of the students at school. No bail... I would like to just to say no bail for him [Suspect]," said a fellow student. READ: Student arrested for Naledi Lethoba's gruesome murder Naledi's parents said that they last spoke to their daughter on 18 May before they were called by police to identify the body at a mortuary. "They took us to the mortuary and when they opened the fridge we couldn't identify her face. It was burned... her body was cut like a cow because some of the meat was not on her. We identified her by the head," said Naledi's father. The alleged suspect, a 19-year-old fellow student made his first court appearance on 30 May and is expected to appear again on 21 June for a formal bail application.
