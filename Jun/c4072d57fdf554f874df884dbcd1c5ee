Sebastian Vettel swaps the number boards at parc ferme after the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. PARIS - Ferrari confirmed they had dropped plans to appeal against a five-second penalty which cost Sebastian Vettel his first victory of the season at last week's Canadian Grand Prix. However, the Italian team said it is considering whether to request an official review of the incident in which Vettel finished the race first on the track but had to surrender victory to Lewis Hamilton following the sanction. "We have withdrawn our intention to appeal but we are looking at asking for a review," said a Ferrari spokesman.
