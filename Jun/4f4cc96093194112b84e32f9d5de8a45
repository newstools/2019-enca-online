Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi gestures as he delivers a speech during his re-elections as president of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) on 5 April 2019, in Kang, Botswana. GABORONE – Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi is confident of a win when he contests his first elections in October. Masisi took over the reins from former president Ian Khama last year, but Khama has since lambasted him about his policy decisions. One of these has been the lifting of the ban on hunting, especially that of elephant hunting. Khama has even resigned from the ruling Botswana Democratic Party, which he served for decades.

However, he couldn't resist taking a jab at Khama. “It’s unfortunate, its also very childish but you know sometimes adults are allowed to be childish, or politicians are allowed to be childish,” said Masisi.

Meanwhile, Khama has endorsed the new Botswana Patriotic Front party.
