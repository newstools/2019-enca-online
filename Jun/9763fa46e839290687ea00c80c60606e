International Monetary Fund. JOHANNESBURG - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged South Africa to speed up structural reforms to boost economic growth. National Treasury says that it's already addressing many of the issues raised during the international lender's visit to the country. The IMF makes two visits annually to the country and meets with the reserve bank, state-owned enterprises and business. It's warned that the country's growth depends on structural reforms, among them improved governance and reducing the cost of doing business. The IMF has singled out Eskom with its R440-billion debt - as a major risk to growth. It wants the country to take robust actions to reduce its fiscal deficit and reverse the increase in public debt.
