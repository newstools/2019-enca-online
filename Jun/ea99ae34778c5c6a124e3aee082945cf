RUSTENBURG - Over 200 members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) remain underground at the Lanxess Mine in Rustenburg in the North West. They have been staging a sit-in since 19 June, demanding recognition of their union, the reinstatement of dismissed workers and the suspension of an official accused of sexual harassment. The group have vowed not to return to the surface until action is taken. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said the members were extremely provoked. "It has been triggered by management to deal with a sexual harassment case," said Jim.
