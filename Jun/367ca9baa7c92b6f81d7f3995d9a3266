READ: Baxter names 23-man Afcon squad Midfielder Dean Furman says they are leaving the country with a lot of positives from their week-long camp in Fourways. “We are coming off a good qualification campaign we were unbeaten. There are a couple of games that stand out especially the Nigeria game and of course the game that we clinched qualification away to Libya", said Furman. SAFA wished the players and technical team well before they departed. At the same time, a clear mandate was not given to Stuart Baxter and his team. "Their focus needs to be on a match by match basis and it speaks for themselves that if they do very well in every single match that’s all we ask them to do by default they will go through all the way so our call to them is to go out and do their best in every single match”, said SAFA CEO, Russel Paul. “If you apply the pressure on the boys and say you need to win the tournament then their focus is on the last match."
