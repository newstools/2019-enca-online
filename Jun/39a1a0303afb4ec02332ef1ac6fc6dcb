Courtesy of #DSTV403 PRETORIA - Nursing union Denosa is defending the nurse implicated in tying an elderly patient to a bench at Mamelodi Hospital. The nurse, three doctors and a security guard have all been placed on special leave pending a probe by the Gauteng Health Department. But Denosa said they have lost faith in the investigation and wants the Health Ombudsman to take over.

It said nurses face daily challenges that compromise their oath to serve. Simphiwe Gada, Denosa Gauteng chairperson, said, “nurses in this country for years have been used as scapegoats when something wrong happens....there were +-71-80 patients at casualty at the time with only eight nurses on duty, that’s also abnormal.

The Health Minister is satisfied with the investigation but he's admitting a shortage of staff and budget-related challenges are plaguing the hospital. Mkhize has urged unions to challenge the final report which is expected in August.
