South Africa will have a chance to show off their skills in front of their home fans in Cape Town. Justin Ford spent time with them. JOHANNESBURG - Women's Rugby continues to grow in South Africa despite facing many challenges. For the first time, Cape Town will host a female version of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series. It is something that not only excites the Springbok Sevens Women's players, but the coach as well. “That’s where want to play. We want to play on the world stage against the best teams in the world. I think we’ve just needed that to be facilitated for us. Again it is going to be a proper wake up call for us. We are, I would say, ten years behind the top teams in the world, but again it would be nice for us to see where we are in terms of that.," Coach Paul Delport said. "We want to qualify for the Olympics in October. We want to qualify for the World Series, next year. But again, we need to be smart in our understanding where we are. You look at the USA, they just won their first World Series tournament in Biarritz. They have 25 contracted players. We have 8.” Athletes from other sporting codes have been introduced to the game. One of those, is former 200m sprinter Alyssa Conely, who represented South Africa at the 2016 Rio Olympics. “I think you after being in an individual sport for 21 years I think it was something that I was seeking, definitely to you know be part of a team now, work with a team, work for a team. So it was amazing, the first day I came here, the girls really embraced me, the team embraced me. I think the first week, it was a bit of an introduction, so I was like yeah I can do this, then I came to the next few camps and the challenge has been tough.”
