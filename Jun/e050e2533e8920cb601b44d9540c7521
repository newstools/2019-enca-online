Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Yet another whale has become the victim of octopus fishing. The City of Cape Town has now joined more than 22,000 people calling on the government to stop the experimental fishing practice in False Bay. This is the second whale that's died after being caught in octopus traps in just 2 weeks. “I’ve seen these entanglements or a whale being dragged then another whale comes close by to investigate we don’t know if it was the mother of the young whale but it came within 50 metres into the shallows,” said Craig Foster of the Sea Change Project. WATCH: Octopus fishing puts Western Cape whales at risk The company involved, Cape Town Octopus has been conducting experimental fishing with the government since 1998. There have been four whale deaths since 2014. The city of Cape Town now wants the government to revoke the fisher’s permit and to remove all octopus fishing equipment until a better method is found. The Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy wants independent scientific advice before proceeding.
