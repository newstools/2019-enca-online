WARSAW - Poland's agriculture minister championed hunting beavers, which are accused of causing substantial damage, claiming the meat of their tails is an aphrodisiac. "If people recall that the tail of the beaver has, apparently, aphrodisiacal qualities, perhaps this problem could be solved," Krzysztof Ardanowski said in parliament. The minister said hunting quotas for beavers, which are protected under the 1979 Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, were far from being depleted.
