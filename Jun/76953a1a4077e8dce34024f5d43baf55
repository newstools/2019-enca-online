Lack of government support and red tape. These are some of the frustrations small business owners hope President Cyril Ramaphosa will tackle during his State of the Nation Address. JOHANNESBURG - Small business owners have urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to announce plans to improve government support and tackle red tape. Ramaphosa delivers his State of the nation address at 7pm on Thursday. Small business owner Sipho Khanyile, who employs twenty people, says he's struggling without government support. “In this area I pay about 28 thousand rand a month, and I have to buy material, pay staff, it’s become very heavy for me. That’s why I have to do extra work, doubling up the shits, sometimes I end up working 3 shifts, a day, night and the next day.” The Gordon Institute of Business Science's Marius Oosthuizen said if Ramaphosa shows leadership in dealing with small businesses, this could increase business confidence and investment.
