JOHANNESBURG - The Limpopo MEC for Economic Development, Environment, and Tourism, Thabo Mokone, says the lions in Phalaborwa are going nowhere. Mokone also added that there will be no darting or relocation of the lions. WATCH: 14 lions on the loose in Limpopo "The lions are free to roam around the area as the community has always been aware of them." It was initially reported that the 14 lions escaped from the Kruger National Park but the MEC says this isn't the case. "We are not going to dart or move them, we know them, they have been part of this area and the community, we know about them." At the same time, Mokone has offered condolences to the family of the guard who was trampled to death by an elephant in the same area.
