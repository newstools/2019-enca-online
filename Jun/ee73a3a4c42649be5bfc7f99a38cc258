The winter solstice will take place on Friday. JOHANNESBURG - The winter solstice, marking the day with the shortest daylight and the longest night of the year, will take place on Friday, 21 June. The June solstice is known as mid-winter in the Southern Hemisphere and will mark the first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. READ: Cold front approaches Western Cape A solstice happens when the sun is at its greatest distance from the celestial equator, twice a year, around June 21 and December 21. This happens when the Earth tilts on its axis and its orbit around the sun, that means sometimes the axis points towards the sun and other times it leans away from it. The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol "sun" and sistere which means "to stand still." The four changes of the seasons, related to the position of sunlight on the planet, are captured in this view from Earth orbit.
