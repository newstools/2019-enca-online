New York City firefighters suit up at the scene after a helicopter crashed atop a building and caused a fire in the Manhattan borough of New York. NEW YORK - A helicopter crashed into a building on Seventh Avenue in midtown Manhattan on Monday, the New York Fire Department said. The department said on Twitter that firefighters were on the scene of the crash landing, which took place in rainy weather.   Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was at the scene soon after the crash, told reporters that it appeared a helicopter attempted a forced emergency landing on the roof and that no one inside the building had been injured. A fire that broke out following the crash was quickly brought under control, Cuomo said. "People who were in the building said they felt the building shake," he said. CNN and other media outlets reported that one person had been killed, citing unnamed sources.
