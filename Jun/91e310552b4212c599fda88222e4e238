Police are remaining mum on whether or not this is the work of a serial killer but with five bodies of middle-aged men murdered in their sleep, the killings have left the capital city’s homeless community concerned about where they will sleep at night and if they will be safe. A homeless man has described how he discovered the body of a man he once shared a bed with at Magnolia Park. “He had deep gashes on his face, also stab wounds to his chest and he was stabbed all over,” said the 28-year-old. LIST: World's worst serial killers Three bodies were discovered in that park 2 weeks ago. The fourth and fifth were found on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Tshwane Leadership Foundation in Pretoria, which tackles homelessness among other issues, says it takes a certain personality to commit such acts. “It’s not really surprising that in society we see these things because some get a kick out to violently attack people that are much less powerful than them, this is a societal issue there’s a policing of homeless of where to be and not to be but this is extreme example of people disregarding their humanity,” said Wayne Renkin from the Tshwane Leadership Foundation.
