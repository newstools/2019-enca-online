Effectively, I AM your boss. You WILL jump when I say so and you WILL ask how high. And when you come to take our lives and land, you WILL die. Our contract is that simple. And don't you forget it”, read Hofmeyr's tweet. Meanwhile, Van Damme made headlines following an alleged racist incident at the V&A Waterfront which lead to her punching a man on the head in 'self-defence.'
