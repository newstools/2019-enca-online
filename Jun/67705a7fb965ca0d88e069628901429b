Speaking to journalists in the capital Harare, the Zimbabwe energy minister, Fortune Chasi has said in addition to the debt to Eskom, millions are also owed to Mozambique's power utility, HCB. “As it is at the moment we owe HCB and Eskom US$83million, very huge amount of money,” said Chasi.
Chasi says the nation should itself brace for hard times as the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority is in shambles due to domestic and foreign debt. The minister admits the situation is critical and is asking for the nation's support. Zimbabwe last experienced such serious electricity blackouts in 2016 following a drought.
