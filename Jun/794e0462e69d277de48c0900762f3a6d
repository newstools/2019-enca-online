We’ve added new renditions - 21 savage with monster and the boys enjoy it”, said Tashinga Chibaya, a pupil. A L L  T H E  W A Y  U P !!!! M O N T A N A !!! H A N N N N N !!!!

The boys say they chose the song All the Way Up because of its instruments that they could also add to their war cry. “If you hear the start of all the way up its got a trumpet note that is pleasing to the ear so we thought to ourselves adding an instrument to the song can take it to the next level. We added the saxophone that replicated the beat, guitar and the saxophone”, he said. Other schools like Parktown Boys' high have also created their own renditions.
