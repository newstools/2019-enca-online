Courtesy of #DSTV403 KIMBERLEY - The Northern Cape provincial government is united and focused on bringing service delivery to all the people in the province, even in areas like Orania. Northern Cape Co-operative Governance Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs MEC Bentley Vass stated the MECs, under the helm of premier Zamani Saul are committed to reconnecting with the community. Vass said, "we need to do things faster, we need to do things better and we need to do things to the best of our abilities." The MEC said the government's "social distance" is too far from the people and it would require effort and resources to change people's lives.

"We don't agree with racist tendencies," said Vass. "We need all people, black and white to work together to change our country for the better. "Orania is there and we want to work with them."
