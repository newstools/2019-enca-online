Perry said the guiding principal behind his success and career has been to “help somebody cross.” He said opening his own studio in Atlanta was to show young black kids that it could be done. “Rather than being an icon, I want to be an inspiration… I want you to hear this: Every dreamer in this room, there are people whose lives are tied to your dream. Own your stuff, own your business, own your way.”
