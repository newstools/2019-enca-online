In April, a man was trampled to death by an elephant in Kasane - a town in the northeastern corner of Botswana. Dorcus Shamukuni’s family is still grieving. “He had four children. Two girls and two boys and the parents and us as the family and now he's gone. All the things he used to do are gone with him", said Shamukuni’s sister, Dorcus Shamukuni. While Buti Sebudubudu’s two brothers were killed in similar attacks. “They are killing us. We can't even plough. The elephants destroy everything. They come into the village and we are not safe anymore”, said Buti. 10-year-old Ontebaganye Ngoma and his grandmother say they narrowly escaped death. “The elephant came and grabbed my leg. My grandmother was holding onto my hand. It tried to pull me then I lifted up my leg and it broke my leg", said Ontebaganye.
