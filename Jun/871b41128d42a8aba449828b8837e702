"The fulfilment is that I've seen these kids come from nothing and the joy I get is seeing these kids on a stage and see what they are able to accomplish, where they didn't even believe in themselves seeing that is priceless," Gomes said. Five crews with a total of 100 dancers are now on their way to Portugal to compete on the international stage.
