JOHANNESBURG - GOOD party leader Patricia de Lille has hailed seven-year-old golf prodigy Simthandile ‘Sim Tiger’ Tshabalala. That's following his latest triumph at the Kids Golf Championship in the United States last week. The seven-year-old golf prodigy continues his remarkable rise to stardom and a number of influential public figures have taken note. Simthandile started playing golf at the age of four and only began competing professionally in the gentleman's sport in 2018.

The golf prodigy is flying the South African flag high and will hope to emulate the likes of Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia and Tiger Woods -- all golfers he admires.
