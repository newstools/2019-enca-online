The country's new Correctional Services minister visited Brandvlei Prison on 29 June 2019. Leigh-Anne Jansen reports. JOHANNESBURG - Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola says new and creative thinking is needed in South African prisons. Lamola visited Brandvlei Correctional Centre in the Western Cape on Saturday and said the system needs an overhaul. "We must be able to ... see this younger generation, these new members, as people who must help us infuse the new values, to infuse a new direction, a new thinking and creative mind," he said. Prisons have, for long, been notorious for overcrowding and lawlessness. "We will be opening new prisons this year, I think one in Tzaneen. We've already opened one in Standerton and the various parts of the country. Kgosi Mampuru is being upgraded. So there is clear work that is already happening, but it's not enough. So we're looking at various ways, including public-private partnerships which are in the pipeline, which will enable us to expedite the process of infrastructure."
