The president has been asked to explain his view on some proposed expansions of the South African Reserve Bank mandate. JOHANNESBURG - ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has released a statement on the state of the economy as well as the mandate of the Reserve Bank. In the statement, Ramaphosa reaffirmed the mandate of the Reserve Bank. "This policy has not changed," he said. "This mandate must be exercised in regular consultation with government through the cabinet minister responsible for national financial matters."

"It is our desire for the South African Reserve Bank to be publicly owned. However, we recognise that this will come at a cost, which given our current economic and fiscal situation, is simply not prudent," the statement read. Ramaphosa said the public spats around the Reserve Bank's mandate were not helpful. A row centring on the bank exposed deep divisions in the governing ANC party on Wednesday. READ: ANC heavyweights divided on Reserve Bank mandate ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule said an agreement to expand the central bank's mandate "to include growth and employment" had been sealed at a three-day party meeting with partners such as labour unions. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said on Wednesday the governing party was standing by Magashule's remarks. He was contradicted by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, a close Ramaphosa ally, who said that no agreement to expand the bank's role had been agreed at the three-day ANC meeting known as a lekgotla. "The officials viewed the recent public spats about the mandate of the South African Reserve Bank as not being helpful, and mitigating and undermining the confidence of citizens and of investors," Ramaphosa said. - Additional reporting Reuters
