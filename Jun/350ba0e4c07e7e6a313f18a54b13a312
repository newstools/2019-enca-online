Areas affected include the City of Johannesburg, Mogale City, Merafong, Emfuleni, and Rustenburg. The water utility says R600-million investment project will see it increasing the raw water it extracts from the Vaal Dam. It says the shutdown is necessary to install a special valve. "We will be connecting a 2500 mm of a valve, between B19 and B11 pipeline. We are talking of a massive pipeline here and we do not want to underestimate the work that is before us," said Rand Water Spokesperson, Justice Mohale. "After we have done the work we have to test if everything is okay because we don’t want to make any mistakes." The City of Johannesburg is telling residents not to worry because its reservoirs are able to meet demand.

That is if there is no flow into the reservoirs... but remember now the purification will still continue so water that is in the purification plant at the moment will still be in the purification plant," said Environment and Infrastructure MMC, Nico De Jager. "We will purify that water and pump that in the intake point that is Paul meet and ache off and from there into our reservoirs across the city." he added. The City's advising residents to use water sparingly in order to avoid running out of this key resource.
