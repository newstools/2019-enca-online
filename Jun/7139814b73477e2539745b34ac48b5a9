For more, we are joined on the line by Bronwen Dyke-Beyer, from Golden Arrow Bus services. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A Golden Arrow bus was set alight in Philippi, Cape Town early on Monday morning. It's believed to be related to protest action. "One of our buses came under attack from a  group of unknown perpetrators. They surrounded the bus which was carrying passengers. They began throwing stones and once the passengers fled they torched the bus", said Golden Arrow Spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer. READ: 'Name and shame those who stoned and burnt buses' Dyke-Beyer strongly condemned the attack saying they (Golden Arrow) are working closely with law enforcement and that they will not suspend their services following the attack. "This is absolutely wrong to private people who are trying to get to work to make a living for their families." No fatalities were reported as investigations continue.
