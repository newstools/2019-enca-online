File: US President Donald Trump is on a state visit in the United Kingdom. WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump appeared to call on Monday for a boycott of AT&T in order to force "big changes" at CNN after criticizing the cable news network's coverage as he began a visit to Britain. "I believe that if people stopped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway," he said in a tweet with a spelling mistake. "It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act? When the World watches @CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!"

The president complained on arriving in Britain that he had watched CNN "for a short while" as a primary source of US news but turned it off. "All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something?"
