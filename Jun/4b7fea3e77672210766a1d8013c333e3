Four hospital officials including two doctors have been placed on special leave, after 76-year-old Martha Marais was found shackled to a bench at the Mamelodi Hospital for eight hours.

Marais said she felt humiliated, helpless and cold while lying under the bench and that her wrists are still hurting from the experience. Following the viral video, calls have been growing for change at the hospital. "There is suggestion that she was a bit confused and a bit violent but we have standard procedural things we have to do and these were not followed," said Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku. Two doctors, a nurse and a security guard have been placed on special leave, pending a full investigation.
