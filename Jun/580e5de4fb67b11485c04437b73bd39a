This follows a number of reports that the children, aged between 11 and 17, were being physically and sexually abused. Western Cape Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez says the decision to remove the children from the facility came after preliminary investigations were conducted.

The department has already placed the children in alternative facilities. They have received counselling and every child will have an individual assessment. Obviously they have different profiles, we don’t yet understand the extent of the abuse and how it was meted out. We do know that the girl children have been more forthcoming in terms of their lived experiences.” Officials at the centre have described the allegations as malicious and untested.
