Ace Magashule is once again in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. JOHANNESBURG - Ace Magashule is once again in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The ANC's secretary-general was mentioned at the state capture inquiry on Tuesday. The inquiry is dealing with allegations linked to SAA. The airline's former Chief Financial Officer Phumeza Nhantsi says she was pushed to conclude a deal with the Free State Development Corporation. She says she heard that one of the firm's executives was related to Magashule. It's not clear who this executive is. "Looking back and knowing what I know, I see that in a way I was used as a scapegoat or as a vehicle for people to enrich themselves," said Nhantsi.
