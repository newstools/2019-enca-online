The South African Transport and Allied Workers’ Union has decided to go after its former secretary general, Zenzo Mahlangu. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Sawatu) is bleeding money fast. The union is laying charges against its former general secretary, Zenzo Mahlangu. Mahlangu allegedly laundered around R65-million in pension money belonging to orphans of deceased mineworkers. READ: Satawu leader was in SA illegally Four years ago, a report from whistleblowers claimed the union was run by foreign nationals. It was claimed these people were willing to use force, including murder, to silence members who spoke about missing money. EXCLUSIVE: Satawu whistleblowers reveal murder, corruption Mahlangu was in April found to have obtained his South African citizenship fraudulently. He was subsequently deported to his home country of Zimbabwe last month. Mahlangu is not allowed to set foot in South Africa for five years, because he’s violated the country’s immigration laws. READ: Union rivalry: Satawu members say they live in fear But whistleblowers say they have reason to believe that he’s been here a few times since his deportation and that’s why they fear for their lives. They say R58-milion of union funds has still not been accounted for. The whistleblowers are pleading with the umbrella body Cosatu to intervene because Satawu is imploding.
