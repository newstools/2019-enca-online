ANC Youth League President Collen Maine wants the ANC NEC to urgently discuss the matter. JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing ANC Youth League President Collen Maine says party leaders who publicly criticise President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appointment of Pravin Gordhan as a minister are ill-disciplined. Maine was responding to Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina who said Gordhan’s appointment undermines the rule of law. He wants the ANC NEC to urgently discuss the matter.

ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says the NEC will discuss the issue. “Part of what we’re doing as we analyse elections, we actually talk openly, frankly and freely, about all those issues and the issue you’re actually raising, it’ll be a subject of the meeting.”
