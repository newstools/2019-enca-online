File: Elton Jantjies is expected to be named on Thursday in the starting side for the meeting at Ellis Park where the Lions are chasing a place in the post-season playoffs. JOHANNESBURG - Flyhalf Elton Jantjies has been restored to the Lions' squad for Saturday's key Super Rugby clash against the Wellington Hurricanes after being left out of last weekend's victory over the Stormers for disciplinary reasons. He is expected to be named on Thursday in the starting side for the meeting at Ellis Park where the Lions are chasing a place in the post-season playoffs. Although it is still not clear what Jantjies did, his coach Swys de Bruin said he had broken "team protocols" during or around the defeat to the Sharks in Durban on May 25. "It's a private matter and something that happened within the team and it's not the first time it happened, but I prefer not to go into detail," the coach said last week. "It's not about the individual. It's about following the protocol." But since last Saturday's 41-22 win, the Lions have looked to rally around the 28-year-old Springbok. "It was handled internally. It was handled pretty well in my opinion. As the players we stood behind him," said captain Malcolm Marx. "It is brilliant to have Elton back, he's one of the big personalities in the squad and his presence gives us a boost," added flanker Marnus Schoeman at training on Tuesday. Janjties, who is expected to be the back-up pivot for South Africa at this year's World Cup, has played in the last three Super Rugby finals - all of them lost by the Lions to New Zealand opposition.
