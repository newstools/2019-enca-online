File: Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur's emotional comment may have been exaggerated to show how passionate he is about his job. LONDON - Head coach Mickey Arthur has claimed Pakistan's World Cup defeat against bitter rivals India was so painful that it left him wanting to "commit suicide". Pakistan suffered a bruising 89-run loss to India in Manchester on 16 June, a result which sparked a furious backlash from their frustrated fans. The defeat put Pakistan's hopes of reaching the World Cup semi-finals in grave danger. And, although they kept alive their slender last-four hopes by beating South Africa on Sunday, Arthur admitted the India loss left him feeling desperately low. "Last Sunday I wanted to commit suicide," Arthur said. "But it was, you know, it's only one performance. "It happens so quick. You lose a game; you lose another game; it's a World Cup; media scrutiny; public expectation, and then you almost go into sort of survival mode. We've all been there."

But some fans feel the South Africa-born coach's words are in bad taste given Pakistan's former coach Bob Woolmer died of natural causes during the 2007 World Cup. Pakistan lifted Arthur's spirts with an impressive 49-run win against South Africa at Lord's. They now need to win their remaining three matches and improve their inferior net run-rate to have a chance of finishing in the top four and advancing to the semi-finals. Pakistan play New Zealand in Birmingham on Wednesday. "We always keep telling our players, it's one performance. Who is going to stimulate us today?" Arthur added.
