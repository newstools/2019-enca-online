Julius Malema says the president is not the captain of industry he is portrayed to be. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema has slammed Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address as being one of futile ideas mixed with fantasy. Debating the State of the Nation Address on Tuesday Malema accused Ramaphosa of not sticking to the ANC’s conference resolutions on land expropriation without compensation and the nationalisation of the central bank. LIVESTREAM: Sona debate "Now that you are elected you have turned your back on the promises you made to the electorate because you undermine our people like that." "Last week you completely retreated on the expropriation of land without compensation and nationalization of the Reserve Bank", said Malema. Malema says Ramaphosa’s a man without a plan and that his reputation as a captain of industry is exaggerated.
