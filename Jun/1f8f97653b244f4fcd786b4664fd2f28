Downtown Buenos Aires during Sunday's power cut. BUENOS AIRES - Argentina has opened an inquiry into what caused a massive blackout that left nearly 50 million people without power, Energy Minister Gustavo Lopetegui said. Technical data from the "black boxes" of two companies responsible for electricity supply will be examined in depth, and the results of the investigation would be published in 15 days, Lopetegui said on Argentine radio. "Thousands of pieces of data" from the two companies, Cammesa and Transener, would have to be analyzed, he said.

"The two companies have to provide the report of what happened over the next 72 hours, with that information Cammesa will provide a report of what happened until 7:07 am, and in 15 days we will know what was the sequence of events that caused the blackout," Lopetegui told Radio La Red. Electricity supply was cut off early Sunday to 44 million people in Argentina and 3.5 million in neighbouring Uruguay. The blackout lasted more than 10 hours. Power was gradually restored through the day. The blackout halted metro and train services in Buenos Aires and forced hospitals and clinics in major cities to resort to using generators. Investigations have so far focused on the electrical supply system from Yacyreta, a hydroelectric dam on the border with Paraguay.

"We have to know why the system did not act as it does every day, because failures happen every day." "There is zero chance of a repetition," he added. Argentina and Uruguay have a common power grid centred on the bi-national Salto Grande dam, 450 kilometres north of Buenos Aires.
