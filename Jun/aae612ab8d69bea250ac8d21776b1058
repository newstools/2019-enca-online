Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The General Council of the Bar (GCB) failed in their Constitutional Court application to have Nomgcobo Jiba and her colleague, Lawrence Mrwebi, struck from the Advocates' Roll on Thursday. The court unanimously ruled that the GCB failed to show the striking off of the roll was a constitutional issue and dismissed the case. The Constitutional Court set aside the costs order made against the GCB.

The axed advocates then took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), which ruled that Jiba should remain an advocate. Mrwebi, however, would be suspended for six months. The GCB then took the matter to the Constitutional Court.
