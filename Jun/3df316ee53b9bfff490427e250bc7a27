Community leader Clive Jacobs says police visibility is not enough and the community is living in constant fear. "When the need is there for SAPS to come around, they are never around, it is complicated to get hold of them because there are other journeys and stuff and they refer you to other police officers but I feel like police are so visible because of the way we live", said Jacobs.
