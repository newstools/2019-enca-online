Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, is praising President Cyril Ramaphosa's attempts at rooting out corruption. Speaking on News Night Madonsela says the appointment of a new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) and other SOE board changes,  is a step in the right direction. WATCH: Ramaphosa in good spirits ahead of Sona "He's (Ramaphosa) appointed a very competent National Director of Public Prosecutions Ms. Batohi. Who's not only competent as being someone who knows the sector but she has appointed equally competent people to help her." "Sars has a senior person appointed there who used to be a Deputy Commissioner there to do the right thing. We've seen now some of the SOEs are beginning to get the right attention and we would like to see more of that attention translating into competent and upright people."
