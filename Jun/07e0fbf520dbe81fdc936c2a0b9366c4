Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is adamant she's not probing money laundering allegations against President Cyril Ramaphosa JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is adamant she's not probing money laundering allegations against President Cyril Ramaphosa. There's been confusion around the scope of Mkhwebane’s investigation after The Sunday Times reported that the Public Protector has widened her probe into Ramaphosa's campaign funds. WATCH: Busisiwe Mkhwebane under fire Mkhwebane's spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, says the investigation is solely focused on Ramaphosa's  R500,000 donation from Bosasa. "The Public Protector has been investigating DA leader Mmusi Maimane's complaint, about Bosasa's R500,000 donation towards Ramaphosa's ANC presidential campaign." The president is expected to receive answers to a list of questions he posed to a witness in the Bosasa donation probe later on Tuesday. He will then file representations to the allegations of wrongdoing against him by Friday, June 28th.
