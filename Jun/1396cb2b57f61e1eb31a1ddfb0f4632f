In her book, The Lost Bride, Badelisile Gaobepe details her experience as a Sangoma and her conversion to Christianity. "I was assigned to write this book because, after having an encounter with the Lord, he asked me to set others free, just like I had been set free", said Gaobepe. WATCH: Meet the 11-year-old that has written eight books Gaobepe says her spiritual journey has challenged her beliefs and spiritual principles but it has also made her feel more alive. "I was a new born again believer, my grand-father had been part of the church, however though I was not rooted in scripture. I did not understand certain things about the word and the spiritual principles and so what happened was as I got baptized and as I got deeper into the spirit, I did not realize that I became more alive in the spiritual realm."
