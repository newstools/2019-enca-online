Already missing from the week-long camp were Keagan Dolly (groin injury) and Rivaldo Coetzee who left to be with his ailing mother in the Northern Cape. Baxter has retained most of the players that have on duty during the Afcon qualifiers. Bafana Bafana is in Group D, together with Ivory Coast who they play in their opening Group game, Namibia and Morocco.
