Ivanka Trump (L) and Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex view displays of US items of the Royal Collection at Buckingham palace. LONDON - US President Donald Trump said Britain's Prince Harry was a terrific guy and denied casting his American-born wife, Meghan, as a nasty person, claiming media had distorted his words as he actually felt she was very nice. Trump met Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles on Monday and was treated to a banquet at Buckingham Palace. Hollywood actress Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, married Charles's younger son Harry last year and gave birth to their first child, Archie, last month. She criticised Trump during his 2016 election campaign as misogynistic and divisive.

I didn’t know that she was nasty." But he also wished her well in her new life as a British royal. Speaking to ITV in an interview aired on Wednesday, Trump clarified the comments saying that he had been referring specifically to Meghan being nasty to him and that he thought she was very nice. "I said: 'well I didn't know she was nasty' - I wasn't referring to she's nasty, I said 'she was nasty about me'," Trump told ITV. "And essentially, I didn't know she was nasty about me. So I said 'but you know what: she's doing a good job - I hope she enjoys her life'. "I think she is very nice. Honestly I don't know her. So I have to be honest - I don't know her," Trump told ITV. "She was nasty to me. And that's OK for her to be nasty. It's not good for me to be nasty to her and I wasn't." Trump said that he had met Prince Harry during the visit: "I did. I did. I congratulated him and I think he's a terrific guy. The royal family is really nice." "I think he is great," Trump said of Harry.
