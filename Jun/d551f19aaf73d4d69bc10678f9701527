Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Many have driven, cycled and even walked from Cape to Cairo but a group of ambitious young men and women wanted to take it to another level. Twenty ambitious teenagers are finally seeing their hard work take to the skies. The group built a Sling-4 aircraft themselves and now are flying it across the continent. They took off from Cape Town International on Saturday morning and their five-week journey will end in Cairo. "I was like oh my word, how cool would it be if 20 teenagers build a plane and then fly it across Africa?! Imagine what that would do to their mindsets," said Megan Werner, who is a pilot.

With no restroom on board, the team will have to have bladders of steel during their 5-hour stretches of flying. A safety aircraft will fly with the group to ensure their safety and send updates. eNCA reporterÂ Pheladi Sethusa has more details in the video above.
