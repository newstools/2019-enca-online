Opening the UNEP wildlife economy summit in Victoria Falls, Mnangagwa called "for the free trade in hunting products as these can have an important impact on national and local economies." "Currently Zimbabwe has about $600-million worth of ivory and rhino horns stocked -- most of which is from natural attrition of those animals. "The revenue would suffice to finance our operational conservation efforts for the next two decades." The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which prohibits the sale of ivory, is under pressure from southern African countries that have seen growing elephant numbers.
