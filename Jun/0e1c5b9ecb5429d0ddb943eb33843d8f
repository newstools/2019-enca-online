Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - Lab results from allegedly poisoned water an Ethekwini council meeting will be released on Monday. Acting eThekwini Mayor, Fawzia Peer, was rushed to hospital after drinking the water and complaining about a burning sensation in her mouth and throat on Thursday. She says whatever the outcome she will continue doing her job. “It's the water that's always placed in council. Somehow this time the water I drank had a funny smell. The smell was kind of paraffin. I don't know who tried to do something. No matter what, it will not deter me. I am much stronger than before,” said Peer. Peer has been acting mayor since Zandile Gumede was forced to take 30 days' leave following her arrest on corruption charges.
