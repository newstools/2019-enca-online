If the government decided to push ahead with wider powers to seize land without payment, it could see local and international investors lose out on land earmarked or already used for mining, farming and other commercial activities. To become law, the reforms would need passed by both houses of parliament and then signed by Ramaphosa. It is unclear how long this process would take. - Additional reporting Reuters
