eNCA speaks to Rand Water Spokesperson Justice Mohale. JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg is urging residents to use water sparingly. This as Rand Water shuts down the water supply, for at least two days, to install a new valve. WATCH: Rand Water cautions against stocking water ahead of shutdown The utility's promising this doesn't mean affected areas will run out of water. Rand Water Spokesperson Justice Mohale says the operation is to start on Monday morning. "The work will start this morning and we want communities to not be scared. People should not panic because we are going to be purifying water from Zuikerbosch as normal. There will be water, we don't encourage people to stock water because that will drain the system and create problems for us,” said Mohale. Among the affected areas, is the City of Johannesburg, Mogale City, Merafong, Emfuleni, and Rustenburg.
