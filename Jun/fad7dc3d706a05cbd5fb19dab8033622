You WILL jump when I say so and you WILL ask how high. And when you come to take our lives and land, you WILL die. Our contract is that simple. And don't you forget it”, read Hofmeyr's tweet. In response to criticism to the tweet, Hofmeyr said "Just teaching SA the actual definition of "public servant". Stop begging to be bullied into oblivion by politicians. (The rest of my tweet is about self-defence)".   In a statement released on Wednesday, the ANC described Hofmeyr's comments as "something that no South African should tolerate”. "The party will lay a charge of crimen injuria against Steve Hofmeyr on behalf of its member and leader comrade Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane", read the statement. The ANC urged South Africans to "isolate people that continue to promote racism in our country."
