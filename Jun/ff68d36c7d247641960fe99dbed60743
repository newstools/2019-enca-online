A Zimbabwean family plays card in Harare after the second power cut, which has hit most parts of the country. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it has not received payment from Zimbabwe, the power utility said on Friday. The country's state-owned power utility owes Eskom more than US$40-million (R563m) for electricity borrowed over the years. “Eskom would like to state that no funds have reflected on its accounts for Zimbabwe’s outstanding debt as at 28 June at 15h00,” Eskom said in a statement.
