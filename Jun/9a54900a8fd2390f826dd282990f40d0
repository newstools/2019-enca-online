JOHANNESBURG - A memorial service for 16-year-old Daniel Bakwela will be held at Forest High School on Tuesday. The teenager was stabbed to death outside the school last week.

READ: Forest High School murder suspect granted bail Mwela is claiming he was defending himself against a gang and says the murder weapon belonged to Bakwela and was dropped during their scuffle. He appeared in court on Monday and was granted bail which has angered the community of Turffontein. NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonodwane says the deceased was involved in another criminal matter which influenced the decision by the State not to oppose bail. “The deceased and one of his friends who was stabbed in this case are actually facing criminal charges in the same court in August so you’ll understand that deciding on whether or not to oppose, the state had to consider a whole lot of facts”, said Louw-Mjonodwane.
