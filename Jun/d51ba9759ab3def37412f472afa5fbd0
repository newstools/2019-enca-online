Often, it's a thankless job. Every day, restaurant employees wait on others, at their every beck and call. And they don't always get a tip for their efforts. #eNCA JOHANNESBURG - Waitress Ayanda Ndlovu will soon realize her dream of becoming a paramedic after she bagged an R 18,000 tip for her amazing service. The 30-year-old was serving a special patron who was enjoying a night out with her friends at the Beerhouse in Fourways.

I told her about myself and about some of my struggles", said Ndlovu. The bill amounted to just over R 1,300 but the customer, who wants to remain anonymous, decided to add something beyond the usual 10-percent tip. "I couldn't believe it. I was just like 'wow'. I believe God is opening doors for me now."Ndlovu never matriculated and she now wants to use the money she received to go back to school and pursue her dream of becoming a paramedic.
