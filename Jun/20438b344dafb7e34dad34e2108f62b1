JOHANNESBURG - Fans of Metro FM presenter DJ Fresh, real name Thato Sikwane, have voiced their frustration on social media after tuning into The Fresh Breakfast Show only to find that he was not on-air. It is not clear why the radio host is no longer on-air, however several media reports suggest that it is due to a scuffle he reportedly had with his co-host Relebogile Mabotja.

Mthembu did confirm that Fresh had been temporarily suspended until further notice. "Reports about a scuffle between DJ Fresh and Relebogile are not true and at this stage the SABC can only confirm that he has been unscheduled on Metro FM until further notice. "The matter is between the organisation and DJ Fresh, and we are not in a position to comment further”, said Mthembu. #BringFreshBack was trending on social media on Monday morning, as several people called for the radio host to return.
