Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Disgruntled doctors have given medical aid giant Discovery a week to respond to their grievances. They marched on Discovery's Sandton office on Friday to hand over a memorandum. The doctors say Discovery has no right to ask them for confidential patient information. They also claim the rate for visits to doctors is too low. READ: Discovery accused of racism Dr Donald Gumede, from the National Health Care Professionals Association, said medical aids are misusing the Medical Schemes Act 131 of 1998 to make money from medical providers. Gumede said medical aids also do not pay claims to healthcare practitioners. "They've created a scheme where they extort money from the patients and extort money from the healthcare professionals," Gumede said.
