READ:Â Sudan: From brutal crackdown to planned talks Following Bashir's removal, protesters camped outside the military headquarters in Khartoum for weeks to demand civilian rule. Several people reportedly died when security and paramilitary forces dispersed them. READ:Â Why Sudan's deadly crackdown on protesters could escalate in coming weeks On Wednesday, shops began to reopen in Sudan's capital but many residents stayed indoors after demonstrators called off a nationwide civil disobedience campaign that had brought Khartoum to a standstill. The slow return to normalcy came after an Ethiopian mediator announced that the protest leaders and the ruling military council had agreed to resume talks following a deadly crackdown on a weeks-long sit-in. The negotiations collapsed last month because the two sides disagreed about whether a civilian or soldier should head a new governing body.
