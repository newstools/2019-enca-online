#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Duduzane Zuma should know his fate on July 12 when judgment is handed down in his culpable homicide and negligent driving case. During closing argument on Thursday, Zuma's lawyers argued the state had failed to prove its case. READ: D-day for Duduzane Zuma Zuma's Porsche collided with a minibus taxi on the M1 in Sandton in 2014, resulting in the death of 30-year-old Phumzile Dube. The defence has argued their client wasn't speeding and the accident was caused by Zuma's car hitting a puddle during rainy conditions, causing the car to spin out of control. The state maintains Zuma was driving over the speed limit and has urged the judge to find him guilty.
