Parliament has cut the budget for the SONA ceremony by 47-percent in comparison to the 2018 Sona budget. From the budgeted R4.7-million in 2018, the actual expenditure came down to R1.9-million. For this Sona, we have budgeted R2.5-million, and we are confident that with the further spending control measures put in place, the actual expenditure will be significantly lower,” Parliament said in a statement. The Sona will be attended by former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe and former National Assembly Speakers Dr Frene Ginwala and Max Sisulu.
