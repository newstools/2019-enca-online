It’s still a case of missing constitutions at Parliament. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - An investigation was launched two weeks ago in Parliament after it appeared that MPs might have made off with more than one copy of the Constitution during their induction. However, a probe has revealed there’s been no theft, only a case of a misplaced box. The National Assembly’s secretary Masibulele Xaso says that cameras were checked and that it might be a misunderstanding. However, some MPs are not happy with the explanation. “We were branded as thieves in the media,” said ANC MP Clarah Dikgale.
