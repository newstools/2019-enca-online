Mogoeng says it is the president's prerogative to appoint Cabinet ministers but he emphasised that the president has a responsibility to make sure that the leaders he chooses are fit and proper. “It matters who becomes a Cabinet minister, it matters who becomes a mayor and a premier, otherwise you wouldn’t have a situation where out of 257 municipalities, only 18 have clean audits, something is fundamentally wrong about this election process,” said Mogoeng who was speaking at the annual Directors Event in Sandton, referred to as South Africa's biggest board meeting. “I think we must start to think about tests that people before they can be elevated to positions of higher responsibility.” READ: Frolick elected Parliament’s chair of chairs Mogoeng says South Africa needs to reconsider how it funds political parties.
