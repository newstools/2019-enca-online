Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Stuart Baxter is close to concluding his 23-man squad for the upcoming Afcon tournament. The African showpiece is just weeks away and Baxter has to let three players go from his provisional side. Afcon’s 24 participants have only a few days left to submit their final squads. Although he did not say when he is going to select his 23-man team, Baxter seems to have identified the positions to cut.
