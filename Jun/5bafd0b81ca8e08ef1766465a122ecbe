eNCA's Moloko Moloto has more. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - It appears that the Democratic Alliance is now looking at a future, without Helen Zille. The party announced that it's Federal Council Chairperson James Selfe will head its governance unit. WATCH: DA presents plan for economic recovery While Zille didn't contest for the position, DA Leader Mmusi Maimane couldn't entertain questions around her suitability for it. " Ultimately as a stalwart of this organization, James remains in our party, will head up the governance unit, and will step down as chair of Fedex in October at that next federal council." "James has done incredible work and an honourable one for our organisation and the fortunes of the DA going into 2021."
