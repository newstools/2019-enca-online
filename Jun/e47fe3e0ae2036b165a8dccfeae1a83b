File: Former minister Bathabile Dlamini. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance has laid another charge against former minister Bathabile Dlamini. This relates to Dlamini’s claim that the wives of prominent ANC figures benefitted from a controversial contract to pay social grants. She made the allegations in her resignation letter earlier this week when she quit as a member of parliament. READ: Bathabile Dlamini resigns from Parliament During her time as Social Development Minister, the Constitutional Court ruled the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was illegal. However, Dlamini has denied accusations that there was a corrupt relationship between herself and CPS. The DA previously laid perjury charges against her for her testimony before a court-appointed inquiry. The opposition party believes Dlamini has also fallen foul of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act for not reporting the corruption she now says accompanied the CPS contract. READ: Dlamini silent on ConCourt payment order “The DA gave Dlamini 48 hours to report to the police the alleged corruption she claimed to be aware of in her resignation letter. "In terms of Section 34 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, any person who suspects or knows of another person who has committed corruption but fails to report the crime to the police, is committing a criminal offence,” the DA said. “Dlamini has for far too long gotten away with evading accountability and the DA will ensure that she along with her ANC cronies get their day in court.”
