British comedian and TV host James Corden and his Hollywood guests tried to nail our South African accent. #CourtesyDStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The Late Late Show host James Corden decided it would be a good idea to test his and his guests' abilities to show off their best South African accents. During an interview, Corden asks actor David Tennant if he was able to nail the accent after filming a project called Good Omens in Cape Town.

"I can start off quite well but it turns out like I’m coming from Birmingham”, said Tennant. Corden then gives it a try and actually sounds like a South African, while actress Elizabeth Banks only managed to say a line by Leonardo DiCaprio from Blood Diamond. “This is Africa,” said Banks.
