Never in his life did the young man think he would ever be separated from football, but his career gave way to a calling of being a Sangoma. Makhaye’s football career looked bright in primary school especially after being compared to the likes of former Bafana Bafana striker Benni McCarthy.

Jean-Pierre was orchestrating everything I was just focusing on football and then one day when he was close to finalizing.... those situations.... my legs were not working", Makhaye said. "I couldn’t get out of the bed and Jean-Pierre was stressed...so we go to Paris Medical care and there was no diagnoses...to Munich no diagnoses went to London no diagnoses...Copenhagen no diagnoses of this paralysis", he explained. When Makhaye returned to South Africa unable to talk or eat, he had no choice but to consult with a traditional healer. "We went back home and four months and I can’t walk can’t even eat I don’t know what’s happening."
