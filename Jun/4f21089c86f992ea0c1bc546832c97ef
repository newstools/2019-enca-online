Since January this year, the Gauteng Department of Social Development has cut funding to the home. It now relies solely on the generosity of people and businesses in Atteridgeville. Courtesy of #DSTV403 PRETORIA - A group 58 orphaned, abusedÂ and neglected children in Atteridgeville are facing uncertainty as the funding was cut to their shelter. The Kingdom Life Child and Youth Centre could be closed after the provincial department of social development denied funding for lack of compliance. The kids at the Kingdom Life each have their own reasons for being there but they have found love and security with their 'gogo' and founder of the home, Nomalizo Magoba.
Magoba established Kingdom Life in her three-bedroom house in 1999 to foster neglected children in her community.
Currently, there are 58 children cared for there, the youngest only four years old.

But the social development department says Kingdom Life's board is unconstitutional and funds have been mismanaged. It plans to move the children. Magoba denies any mismanagement of funds and says the home is willing to vote in a new board for the sake of the children.
