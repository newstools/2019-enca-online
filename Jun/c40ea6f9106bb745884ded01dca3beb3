Congolese rhumba musician and convicted rapist Koffi Olomide was scheduled to perform at Shimmy Beach Club in Cape Town on 30 June 2019. JOHANNESBURG - Congolese musician and convicted rapist Koffi Olomide will no longer perform in South Africa following an outcry from women's rights groups. On Tuesday, Shimmy Beach Club in Cape Town confirmed it had cancelled the June 30th show, after a petition by The Stop Koffi Olomide Collective called for the artist to be banned from performing in the country. This was followed by Gallagher Convention Centre's announcement on Wednesday morning, that it too had cancelled Olomide's show, which was due to take place on 28 June.
