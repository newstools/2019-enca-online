WATCH: More than 120 arrested in KZN political killings “The manner in which he was killed is very painful, brutal and it shows high level of criminality. We believe that whilst in the province, there's this challenge of killing of leaders, we don't want to conclude whether this is political killing or not. We call on police to open their net wide,” said Zikalala. The task team dealing with political killings in KwaZulu-Natal will be investigating the case.
