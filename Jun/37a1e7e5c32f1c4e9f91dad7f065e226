Trying to reach all those goals at the same time and not drop the ball is a lot of work,” Manaleng said. “I'm used to being in the background talking about what other people have achieved. Talking about myself is not my thing,” she added. Kyla Herrmannsen is a producer for CheckPoint. “I think for me, you know that mantra of journalists telling stories of the voiceless has always annoyed me a bit because they're not the voiceless. They have incredibly loud important voices. I think our job is to acknowledge and to resource people where their stories come across. ... Everyone's stories important,” said Herrmannsen.
