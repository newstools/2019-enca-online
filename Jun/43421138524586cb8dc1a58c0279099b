Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - There are no short-cuts and no quick fixes. This is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s response to critics who are saying the country needs more than dreams to rise out of its slump. Responding to the debate on his State of the Nation Address (Sona), Ramaphosa said his team is working hard behind the scenes to bring much-needed investment and jobs to South Africa. Ramaphosa says state-owned companies have a critical role to play in driving economic growth and transformation but stabilising the country’s energy supply is fundamental to economic recovery. “We have done much to address governance challenges at several state-owned enterprises and been decisive in tackling corruption and state capture,” said Ramaphosa. WATCH: Opposition parties slam Ramaphosa's Sona speech Ramaphosa has also touched on the importance of land expropriation. “Our land reform agenda also includes recognising individual, family and community rights to land in accordance with lived experience,” he said. For opposition parties, Ramaphosa’s reply doesn't go far enough. “Even though today was more about the detail he was trying to achieve, it lacked choices, and it lacked reform. And what SA needs if it’s going to prosper in the future, is tough decisions,” said DA leader, Mmusi Maimane. “We want to see in the end what the results are going to be. And the economy is going to determine that. I’m not optimistic,” said Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald. But Ramaphosa said South Africans shouldn't have to choose between responding to the country’s immediate problems and preparing for its future.
