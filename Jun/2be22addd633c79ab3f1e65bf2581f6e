Let's make sense of why almost ten former ministers were not willing to continue serving as ordinary Members of Parliament. Courtesy #DStv403 PORT ELIZABETH – Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani says cabinet ministers should lead by example if they want mayors to use public transport instead of expensive vehicles. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma urged mayors to implement cost-cutting measures. In regulations, gazetted on Friday, mayors were instructed to consider using public transport before procuring new vehicles.

"Let them lead us by example. I am absolutely not opposed to using public transport, but our leaders on top must lead us by example.” Bobani said government should also look at fighting "this disease", corruption. "National government together with all the local governments, if we can all come together to fight corruption, then we can save a lot of money."
