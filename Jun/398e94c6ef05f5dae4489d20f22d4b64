The South African Cabin Crew Association has been calling for former CEO Vuyani Jarana to remain at the helm of SAA. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) wants Vuyani Jarana to stay on as SAA CEO. The national carrier's board on Friday announced the appointment of Zuks Ramasia as acting-CEO. READ: Zuks Ramasia appointed acting SAA CEO Jarana resigned last week citing funding uncertainty and lack of support from government among his reasons. SACCA has questioned Ramasia's appointment. READ: SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana resigns "The only problem that we have is that when you allow people to act for a very long time then it becomes a problem. What support are they going to give Miss Zuks that they weren't giving Jarana? Are they going to be doing favours for Zuks that they weren't doing for Jacana? You can't be doing favours like that when the rand is dropping and picks up. You need to make decisions... In SAA a position like CEO cannot be micro-managed," said Mpho Moikangoa, from SACCA. Ramasia was previously SAA's General Manager of Operations.
