Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - After days of silence on social media Zindzi Mandela tweeted late last night saying she's back from her trip and will take a stroll down twitter's streets on Wednesday. The ambassador to Denmark ruffled some feathers with a string of tweets, using the hashtag Our Land and The Land Is Ours. WATCH: Calls for Zindzi Mandela's recall following tweet backlash Nelson Mandela's daughter tweeted, "Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs." Responses to her comment on the sensitive issue varied, with some calling for her diplomatic recall. Lobby group AfriForum called for her dismissal. AfriForum deputy CEO Alana Bailey says Mandela's views are contributing “to the division of local communities”. The DA also says her comments are divisive and warrant that she be recalled.

The Department of International Relations says it's still verifying the authenticity of the Twitter account.
