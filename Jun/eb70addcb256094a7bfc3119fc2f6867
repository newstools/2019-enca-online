File: President Cyril Ramaphosa asked to cross-examine some of the people the Public Protector interviewed. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa must respond to the Public Protector's Bosasa report on Friday.
The President received a donation of R500,000 from Bosasa to fund his ANC presidential campaign. Ramaphosa had said the payment was made to his son, Andile. READ: Ramaphosa's son denies Bosasa wrongdoing He later wrote to then Parliamentary Speaker, Baleka Mbete, admitting the money was, in fact, a donation from Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. Busisiwe Mkhwebane is examining whether Ramaphosa deliberately lied to Parliament about the donation. This would amount to a breach of the executive ethics code.
