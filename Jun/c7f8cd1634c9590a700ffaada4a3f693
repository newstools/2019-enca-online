The Northern Cape premier says his administration will clarify the status of these towns, and determine their future.

"I was part and parcel of the task team which was set up by comrade Sydney Mufamadi when he was the minister of Cogta," Saul said. "We've not concluded that work. "We need to conclude that work to look at the status of Orania to better conceptualise our approach in dealing with similar areas."

Saul is facing pressure to act fast as construction is beginning on similar developments like Eureka just a few hundred kilometres away.
