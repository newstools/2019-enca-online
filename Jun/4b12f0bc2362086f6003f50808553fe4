"And they have to, after the operation they have to, they have no choice." The ban went into force in April following a protracted legal battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court. The Pentagon says the restrictions are not a blanket ban. But they do bar an overwhelming majority of people who identify as transgender from enlisting. The policies could also impact currently serving personnel. "We have a great military and I want to keep it that way," Trump told ITV.
