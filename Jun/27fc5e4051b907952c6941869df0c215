eNCAs Pheladi Sethusa has more. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town is planning for the worst-case water scenario. The city's water supply has stabilised significantly over the last year and now the Cape government has approved a new 10-year strategy. This includes a permanent desalination plant. WATCH: Government agrees to pay Gift of the Givers for Makhanda intervention The city that almost ran out of the water, is now implementing the costly plan to ensure another Day Zero scenario is near-impossible. City of Cape Town Mayco member Xanthea Limberg estimates between R5.4 and R5.8-billion needs to be invested over the next 10 years.
"We are estimating approximately between R5.4 and R5.8 billion that needs to be invested over the next 10 years to ensure that we can add an additional 300 million litres of water to the city to sustain our growing demand." WATCH: Water a hot topic in South Africa There will still be a heavy reliance on dam water and by extension, steady rainfall. According to the eNCA weather centre, the current season has been disappointing so far. 
"Well on the 12th of June the provincial average for Western cape dams was 48%, with Theewaterskloof, Steenbras Lower and Wemmershoek around 40% and the Berg River Dam at just below 73%. This year between January and May we have had below average rainfall for the Western Cape. Unfortunately, seasonal forecast models perform poorly for the winter rainfall regions, but they are optimistic with average to above average rainfall expected for June and July."
