READ: Mshozas loving her new look "Me, just when I am naked, with this body and that's before I wear the bra and the panties, I am worth more than R300,000. That is just my breast, bum, nose. I am worth R500,000 actually, when I think of the nose," said Mshoza. Mshoza advised anyone with less than a million rand in their account not to bother calling or texting her. "So if you’re gonna keep calling me or sending me WhatsApp messages, look at yourself first. Think about it and think hard because I’m expensive, guys. Check the people you ask out, their beauty is not free, they paid for it. Calm down with your R5,000. Stop sending me WhatsApp messages, stop calling me if your account is less than a million, please."
