He’s of the view the Zondo Commission lacks impartiality. Nevertheless, Zuma’s undertaken to appear over five days in July. Meanwhile, Zuma's attorney Lungisani Daniel Mantsha is accusing the commission of trying to turn the public against the former president. READ: Former president Zuma agrees to attend State Capture Inquiry Mantsha records the following 'distinct' impression: “…that you seek your own truth and to deliver our client to the Commission for public display and in order to ambush and humiliate him rather than to fulfil the mandate of the Commission…” The former head of state has expressed his views on state capture before. “Absolutely. There is no state that is captured. Even when people try to describe it – worse when they try to give evidence. Some people were doing things with other people […] is the judiciary captured? Is parliament captured? Is the executive captured? So where is the state capture?” READ: Opposition parties hope Zuma heeds state capture call In a curt statement on Tuesday, the commission noted Zuma’s undertaking. It did not address any claims he or his lawyer made of bias or political meddling.
