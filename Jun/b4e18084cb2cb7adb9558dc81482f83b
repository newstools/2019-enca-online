JOHANNESBURG - The National Assembly speaker Thandi Modise says she's seeking advice on how to deal with the DA's request to institute proceedings to remove Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane. DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen wrote to the speaker over the matter. READ: Mkhwebane must go: DA The party approached Parliament last year, saying it should consider Mkhwebane's removal following the North Gauteng High Court's decision to set aside the Bankorp/CIEX report with costs. In February, the Justice Portfolio committee chose not to fast-track the removal bid. The DA says the latest court judgment in the Vrede dairy farm matter once again proves that Mkhwebane’s not fit for office and that it will again push for her removal. READ: DA to push for Public Protector's removal Modise said her office has responded to the DA to say that she is taking legal advice on the matter. "I have no opinion on the matter that is why I want to refer the matter to appropriate people who will then have enough time to look at recommendations."
