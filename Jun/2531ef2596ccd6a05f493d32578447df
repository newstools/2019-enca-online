She was in tears. Said she had been getting death threats on social media all night this morning she disabled her IG account just to make it stop", said Shelburne. According Shelburne's tweets, Curran was her trying to find out if the couple wanted something to drink, as she had invited them to the game. "Curran says Jay Z asked for a vodka soda. She asked if he wanted lime with that. But it was loud in Oracle and she couldn’t hear, so she leaned over. That’s where the photos of Beyoncé looking askance at her come from." Meanwhile Beyonce’s publicist Yvette Noel-Shure has responded on Instagram following the incident and urged the Beyhive to 'spread love.' I am looking back today at the start of The OTRII tour, one year ago. It was a place of joy, unimaginable entertainment from two of the best performers in the world, and a place of love. Every single day on that tour I saw love. Which is why I also want to speak here to the beautiful BeyHiVE. I know your love runs deep but that love has to be given to every human. It will bring no joy to the person you love so much if you spew hate in her name. We love you. 🐝 🐝 🐝 A post shared by  Yvette Noel-Schure (@yvettenoelschure) on Jun 6, 2019 at 8:09pm PDT
