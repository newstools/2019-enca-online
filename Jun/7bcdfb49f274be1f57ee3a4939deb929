eNCA's Tshegohaco Moagi speaks to a young depression survivor. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Speak out and seek help. That's the message of the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) for youths struggling with mental illness. The organisation says young people often don't open up about their trials and tribulations. According to one depression survivor, Keamogetswe Monyai, it's easy to lose all your energy. "At times you cannot cope anymore like you become a mess. You get warnings left, right and centre from work. You don't have the energy for anything, not for life, nothing. No energy to wake up, you just want to shut down from the world." Sadag is urging young people to use their voices if they feel down for a prolonged period.
