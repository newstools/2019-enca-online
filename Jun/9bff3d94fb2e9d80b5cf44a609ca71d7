JOHANNESBURG - Rand Water says its R600-million upgrade is on schedule to install a butterfly valve to the pipeline from the Lethabo to the Vereeniging pumping stations. The deadline is at midday on Wednesday. READ: Rand Water shutdown update Rand Water says the upgrade is a response to the increasing water demand and was originally on their 2020 projections.
Rand Water executive manager, Eddie Singo said, "we have now cut the piece that needs to be removed so that we can slot in the valve and the welding will start." "It is anticipated that we should finish the welding by at least early in the morning tomorrow and then we commission the line before 12 o'clock." READ: Rand Water says don't panic as shut down begins The water utility says this project will soon be followed by more maintenance to infrastructure. Singo stated plans for maintenance extend to 2023, replacing pipes affected by corrosion and are leaking. Singo added the upgrade will help with future repairs so water won't have to be cut.
