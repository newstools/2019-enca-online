Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A fire at Metallica Chemicals in Cato Ridge is causing panic. The fire broke out in a warehouse allegedly used to store mercury chloride. The smoke plume from the facility is believed to be a serious health risk to those in and around the area. READ: St Francis Bay fire under control Smoke emitted from the factory poses a health risk, as the neurotoxin released can cause numerous symptoms including blurred vision, headaches, memory loss, brain damage and in extreme cases, death. The local ward councillor, Musa Mkhize, believes foul play was involved. “Somebody broke in for whatever, or to interrupt the investigation that is happening because we believe that what is happening here is illegal, we also believe that this thing is kept here illegally.” Earlier this month Metallica Chemicals, formerly known as Thor chemicals, came under the spotlight for missing its 2013 projected deadline to remove the toxic mercury waste. Metallica Chemicals has declined to comment but says it will release a statement in the coming days.
