File: This year's event honouring the best television shows is scheduled for September 22. LOS ANGELES - Like the Oscars before it, the upcoming 71st Emmy Awards ceremony will go on without a celebrity host. The decision will allow the September ceremony to dedicate more time to the television shows nominated for honours, said Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier. "If you have a host and an opening number, that's 15-20 minutes that you don't have to salute the shows," Collier said at a gathering of industry reporters. The last time the Emmys skipped having a host was in 2003. It only happened two other times, in 1975 and 1998. READ: Oscars to take place without a host This year's event honouring the best television shows is scheduled for September 22. The decision to go ahead without a host could help shake up a ceremony often considered too slow, which suffered from disappointing ratings last year. In February, the Oscars also decided to go without a host after their original choice for the job, Kevin Hart, pulled out when old homophobic tweets of his resurfaced. In the end the event was considered a success and the show enjoyed an increase in ratings over the previous year.
