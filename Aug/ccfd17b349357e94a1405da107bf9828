JOHANNESBURG - Errors happen, but when they happen on social media there's no mercy for the ill-informed. This is especially true for a White House reporter from an international wire news agency, who snapped a photo of four world leaders at the G7 Summit in France on Sunday. Darlene Superville tweeted an image (see above) of French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a "bear hug" with "one unidentified leader", also known as our own President Cyril Ramaphosa. South Africans were having none of that!
