File: Uber already provides electric scooters for rent in several cities in the United States. JOHANNESBURG - Western Cape police urge Uber and Bolt (formerly Taxify) drivers to avoid various locations in Cape Town following a hike in hijackings in Nyanga. Western Cape MEC for Community Safety, Albert Fritz on Wednesday called on police to identify and arrest those involved in these hijackings. READ: Cape Town ranked 11th deadliest city globally "I have received reports of increased hijackings taking place in Nyanga. It is my concern that we are seeing a form of crime displacement known as ‘type of crime’ displacement following the recent SANDF and SAPS joint operations,” Fritz said. Drivers are urged to avoid hotspot areas such as Govan Mbeki Road in Philippi, Bristol and Sheffield Roads in Browns Farm, Klipfontein Road, Miller Road and Eisleben roads in Nyanga and Crossroads. Fritz added that members who may have information that would contribute to making their community safer should report it to the police. READ: Murders in Cape Town on the rise "We cannot allow the booming e-hailing industry to besieged by criminals. This industry empowers many individuals residing within the province as it provides countless job opportunities, improves the economy and makes the province more accessible for tourists." "An attack on the transport industry is therefore always an attack on the people of the Western Cape,” he concluded.
