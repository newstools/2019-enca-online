JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has blasted CAFÂ for their lack of consistency in applying their rules. The Brazilians are the only semi-finalists who will take part in the preliminary round when they face Congo outfit AS Otono on Sunday. TP Mazembe, who were also knocked out in the last four, have skipped the prelims and head straight into the first round. But Pitso is not happy. "The CAF principles are a little bit inconsistent," he said. "The format needs to be consistent. But that's the way it is, you've got to move on."
