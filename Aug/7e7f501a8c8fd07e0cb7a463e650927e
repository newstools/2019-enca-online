Courtesy of #DSTV403 CAPE TOWN - Over 90 Cape Town business owners at the Salt River market are on the brink of losing it all after the municipality gave the green light for demolition of what some refer to as a heritage site. The proposed development is to make way for business units and affordable housing but some community members say this feels like an eviction.

Another business owner already feels as though he has lost his livelihood. Annees Anderson said his shop, Cedar Paint, is not operational due to lack of business after the news spread that the market is closing down. Customers and the community are furious.

MMC for Human Settlements, Malusi Booi said, 'people who are in the market that are currently trading, those people we will make sure they have spaces because that particular present has more than 2,000 square metres that are earmarked for those businesses."
A few metres from the market there's another side of town, with no plans to demolish it.
