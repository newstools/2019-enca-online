President Cyril Ramaphosa has secured an interim interdict to stay the Public Protector's remedial action on the Bosasa report. PRETORIA - The Public Protector will oppose President Cyril Ramaphosa's application to set aside her Bosasa report. The North Gauteng High Court has given Ramaphosa some breathing space by interdicting Busisiwe Mkhwebane's remedial action pending the outcome of a judicial review. The next court battle between the two could reveal information the president is trying to keep secret. There's no need for Ramaphosa to declare details of the funding of his ANC leadership campaign in Parliament. Ramaphosa can't be hauled before Parliament's ethics committee for deliberately misleading MPs and neither the police nor the National Prosecuting Authority can investigate him for money-laundering related to the CR17 campaign, at least, for now. READ: Fundraising for Mkhwebane surpasses R100k Judge Peter Mabuse has ruled in favour of the president because Mkhwebane did not oppose the interdict application. However, Ramaphosa still has to convince the court, on a date that's yet to be set, why the Public Protector's Bosasa report must be reviewed and declared invalid. Ramaphosa believes Mkhwebane's investigation into his CR17 campaign was unlawful as she has no jurisdiction to probe matters outside the domain of the State. The president must also convince the court why he's so desperate to hide banking details related to the campaign, if there was no wrongdoing. Mkhwebane is yet to file her responding affidavit but it's expected she'll have to explain how Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament, while she says he responded to a question by the DA, in good faith. President Cyril Ramaphosa has ben granted a reprieve from facing remedial action relating to his ANC presidential funding campaign. Courtesy #DStv403
