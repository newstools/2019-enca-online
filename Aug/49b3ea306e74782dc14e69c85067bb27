A whimsical invitation on Facebook has urged UFO enthusiasts to gather on 20 Sepember and "storm" Area 51. RACHEL, Nevada - Residents in the tiny US desert outpost of Rachel, Nevada, believes they are coming no matter what. Not aliens, but alien hunters. A whimsical invitation on Facebook has urged UFO enthusiasts to gather on 20 September and "storm" nearby Area 51, a US military base long rumoured to house extraterrestrials and spaceships. More than 2 million Facebook users have said they plan to go. But residents are split on how to respond. Some sternly warn the public to stay away, fearing large crowds will overwhelm a town with no gas station or grocery store.

The US government did not confirm the base existed until 2013 when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes. The documents made no mention of little green men or flying saucers, but that did not end suspicion. "Any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous," an Air Force statement said in response to questions about the event. The Air Force said it uses the facility to test combat aircraft and train personnel. The entrance is dotted with cameras and signs warning against trespassing.
