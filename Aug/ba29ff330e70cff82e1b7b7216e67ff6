READ: Here is your Springbok Rugby World Cup squad Siya Kolisi has recovered from his injury and will lead the 31-man squad, coached by Rassie Erasmus. “Obliviously the ultimate dream is to win the World Cup and that’s been the coach’s message since he started with us. The way he’s worked with us…he’s taught us a lot of things. If the coach says something…he tells us openly as players as well, so we have that sense of responsibility and honesty within the team which makes it black and white that you have to give your best at all times,” Kolisi said.
