However, Motsoeneng has described the report as nonsensical. “I am the first person at the SABC to make sure that all employees are treated fairly,” he said. “The workers at the SABC were all happy. This is a journey of people tarnishing our name. I did transform the SABC and I don’t apologise. All the decisions I have taken, I stand by the decisions.”
