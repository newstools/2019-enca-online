READ: Calls mount for Public Protector's head "What I'm going to do is go to a local police station and lay a charge of perjury and defeating the ends of justice against the PP. Her conduct and the way she has been in denial is not serving the public interest in SA," said director Paul Hoffman on Monday. "I would hope the criminal justice realises the urgency of the matter and deals with her. We can't have a convicted perjurer as our PP... Whether the law society gets on with its job of having her struck off the roll."
