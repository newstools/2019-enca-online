The Center for Applied Legal Studies and Open Secrets submitted a complaint about the role of European banks during apartheid. READ: Apartheid-era laws not always unconstitutional: lawyer Tumelo Matlawa from the centre for applied legal studies says they have evidence that the banks enabled a money-laundering scheme using shell companies to help the apartheid government buy weapons. “Essentially we work to hold corporations accountable for human rights violations, apartheid is one of the biggest human rights violations in history,” Matlawa. “We are trying to hold corporations that were complacent in this, benefited from this and profited from this.”
