JOHANNESBURG - Eskom technicians were repairing electricity pylons on Main Reef Road in Johannesburg on Friday afternoon after thieves stole steel components from the towers. On Thursday, videos emerged on twitter, showing the pylons with missing parts. In a statement released on Friday, Eskom said it was replacing the stolen "tower members andÂ damaged lattice towers with mono-poles as part of phasing out the infrastructure that is prone to theft". The power utility said pylons were often vandalised, causing the structures' collapse. "This does not only compromise the integrity of the network but also causes prolonged power supply interruptions affecting customers and further posing a serious risk to the public." Eskom said it had increased inspections of infrastructure in high-risk areas but was unable to do so on a 24-hour basis.
