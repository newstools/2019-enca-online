Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Dozens of families are homeless following a relocation order by the Western Cape High Court. Residents of Klein Akker in Kraaifontein are refusing to move to Philippi on the Cape Flats. The farm dwellers are now in limbo, forced to stay on an abandoned farm. The evicted residents claim they were offered scant compensation to move. WATCH: Red Ants evict people in Randburg flatlands Klein Akker resident, Felicia Kektoor says they can’t move to Philippi because the area is far from their workplace. “They wanted to move us to Philippi, but it was too far for the people. Most of the people are farm workers they are working in the area. Our children go to school here, they offered to pay us R20 000, but that was not in writing hence we didn’t take it.” Agriculture and rural development deputy minister, Mcebisi Skwatsha, says the accommodation is for interim bases. “This is a temporary measure by our department, to house people in our facility whilst alternative mechanisms that will be a lasting solutions are being found out.”
