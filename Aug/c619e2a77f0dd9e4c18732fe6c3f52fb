Imagine having a glass of your favourite wine, but without all the nasty side effects of alcohol. CAPE TOWN - Imagine having a glass of your favourite wine, but without all the nasty side effects of alcohol. Well, de-alcoholised wine is fast becoming a trend. Western Cape winemaker Eugene van Zyl said the demand is growing. "We've picked up this trend two years ago actually on the overseas market where there's real growth, a trend picking up fast in South Africa," Van Zyl said. But what is the difference between a non-alcoholic and de-alcoholised variant?
"De-alcoholised wine is a wine less than 0,5 percent alcohol, ours is 0,34 percent and a non-alcoholic wine is less than 0,05 percent."
Producers say this versatile blend is for the health-conscious, as well as those who want to enjoy a glass of vino while still having to focus.
