Courtesy #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Home Affairs Department wants to ensure equality in marriage legislation. It engaged with gender and human rights activists on a new marriage policy on Friday. The department wants fair principles and practices in the Marriage Act. "What we are trying to do, as you know the current marriages in South Africa are managed by three pieces of legislation, so we need to do harmonisation in that.

The aim of the dialogue is to determine how to ensure equality, human dignity and fair principles in marriage legislation. "We are trying to ensure that there is equality, in terms of the law because the constitution promotes equality but again the current marriage relation does not take into consideration that principle of equality. "For example, we have people who say they will not marry people of same-sex orientation, so we are trying to ensure that the marriage policy covers that."
