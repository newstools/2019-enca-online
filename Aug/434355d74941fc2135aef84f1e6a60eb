File: Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba. JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman has blamed the national government for the chaos in the Joburg CBD. In a series of tweets posted on Monday, Mashaba said the ANC is allowing the lawlessness to continue in the area. "Unfortunately the undercurrent is political. The@MYANC is willing to allow lawlessness to flourish, by not prosecuting and working with@coj_gfis  & @JoburgMPD just so they can claim we're not doing a good job. They don't care who suffers, they just want to do as they please," said Mashaba in a tweet.
