Courtesy of #DSTV403 CAPE TOWN - Gansbaai in the Western Cape is struggling to cope with refuse spilling into the sea but marine biologists are fighting back. They have installed a litter-catching stormwater net, the first of what they hope will be many. READ: Morocco's litter-strewn beaches kick up a stink There are 63 stormwater drains in Gansbaai but they pose a major threat to marine life because they transport not only water but also, waste. Biologists from Marine Dynamics are taking action. Marine biologist, Allison Towner, said, "we've recently necropsied an African penguin which was dead, because of plastic in its stomach causing ulcerations." Towner explained the biologists have installed a specialised storm drain with a net.

Cigarette butts, plastic and paper are among the most common items collected. They are pleading with communities to also take a stand. Five more of these drains are expected to be installed across the area in hopes of minimising sea pollution.
