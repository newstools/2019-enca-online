The ANC in the Western Cape is rudderless.  Its National Executive Committee announced on Friday that it was disbanding the province’s interim leadership. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte is meeting with the party’s provincial structures in Cape Town on Monday to chart the way forward. The National Executive Committee disbanded the province’s interim leadership on Friday. The disbandment follows years of infighting and fractures with the party unable to wrest control of the province, from the DA over the past decade. The ANC pulled out all the stops ahead of the May polls in a desperate attempt to expand its footprint in the Western Cape but instead, support declined in the only province it doesn’t govern - mustering only 28.5-percent of the provincial vote. The term of the former acting provincial executive expired in June.

Just like you we see on social media that the WC PEC has been disbanded, we have not been informed officially. Even if that is the case, it will not have any impact on how the caucus functions, because the caucus reports to the regional executive committee which is still intact.” There hasn't been a provincial conference since 2015. The ANC NEC says the provincial interim committee will have to implement a process of renewal and rebuilding in the province and that its efforts to reclaim the Western Cape, remains on course.
