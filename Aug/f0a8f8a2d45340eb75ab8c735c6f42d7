Cele says he believes that police will win the war against crime in the Johannesburg CBD. “We will be winning this battle, it can’t go on like this forever,” Cele said. “We can’t have the co-governance with criminality, this is the co-governance with criminality that must be put off and make sure that government and everybody else runs the country accordingly.” READ: Joburg vendors call for talks following violent clashes The inner city spiralled into chaos last week when police clashed with shop owners.
