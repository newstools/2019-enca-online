Courtesy of #DSTV403 CAPE TOWN - Communities across Cape Town have joined forces to protest what they call the government's failure to deliver on housing on Thursday. Frustrated locals, mostly backyard dwellers, claim they're being ostracised. They say there is a lack of housing opportunities for coloured people. Major roads leading in and out of the Cape Town CBD are expected to be shut down. The areas reportedly affected are Buitengracht closed at Shortmarket Street towards Table Mountain.

Community safety MMC JP Smith said in a statement, "the organisers have not engaged with us directly, and we cannot predict the extent to which the shutdown will be supported and what impact there will be."

The City called for peaceful protest and engagement that will not prevent free movement or cause damage.
