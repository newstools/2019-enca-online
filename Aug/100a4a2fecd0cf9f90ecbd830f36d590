There has been mounting calls for the removal of Busisiwe Mkhwebane as Public  Protector. JOHANNESBURG - The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services will look into the fitness of the Public Protector. Chairperson of the committee, Bulenani Magwanishe, confirmed on Wednesday that “the committee has received communication from the Office of the Speaker regarding a request to look into the fitness of Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane, Public Protector, to hold office.” Magwanishe, however, said the committee has not had the opportunity to discuss the request.

"It is only after that the committee would be able to comment further on this matter.” There has been mounting calls for the removal of the Public Protector after the Constitutional Court found that she acted in bad faith when she investigated the South African Reserve Bank's bailout of Bankorp. The Public Protector is currently fighting separate court cases with President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.
