Manchester United's Marcus Rashford. SOUTHAMPTON - Manchester United has failed to get back to their winning ways after being held by a 10-man Southampton at St Mary's. The Red Devils were looking to bounce back from a shock 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace last time out. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's charges took a 1-0 lead against the run of play when new signing Daniel James scored his third goal in four outings since joining from Swansea City. United surrendered their lead in the second half when Jan Vestergaard's towering header made it 1-1. That's how it stayed for the remainder of the match.
