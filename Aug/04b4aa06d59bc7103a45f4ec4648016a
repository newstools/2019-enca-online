Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Brick by brick, ladies are taking the construction industry to new heights with the Leonardo in Sandton, set to be Africa’s highest building. A predominantly female team is overseeing the creation of the 55-storey skyscraper. A one-bedroom flat will sell for about R5-million and if you want the 3000 square meter Leonardo suite, you’ll have to cough up R250-million. The building is expected to come in at around R3-billion. At 233 meters high, it will become the tallest building on the African continent, surpassing Carlton Centre’s 50 floors which for decades remained unchallenged in the sky. eNCA reporter Dimakatso Leshoro met some of the ladies working behind the scenes on this mammoth project.
