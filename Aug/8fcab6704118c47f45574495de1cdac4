Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Adam Catzavelos has reached a settlement with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). Catzavelos apologised for his rants and has agreed to pay R150 000 to a charitable organisation promoting social cohesion. He will pay R5,000 for over 30 months. Last year, a video of him using the k-word on a Greek beach went viral on social media. A moment of madness: Catzavelos on k-word rant Earlier this month, the SAHCR case in the Equality Court was postponed after the magistrate recused himself because of ties to Catzavelos's lawyer. Greek authorities are pursuing charges based on its recently strengthened anti-racism law.
