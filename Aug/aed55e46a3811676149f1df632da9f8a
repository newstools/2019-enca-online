Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The DA has been warned that it won't be easy to remove Busiswe Mkhwebane as Public Protector. DA federal executive chairperson, James Selfe says this is the view of the party's lawyers. The party is pushing for a parliamentary inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said his party has agreed that Mkhwebane is unfit for the office of the Public Protector.

The DA, however, said that it would continue to keep an eye on the Bosasa matter.

Maimane also called for a broader inquiry into how ANC politicians personally benefitted from their relationship with Bosasa.
