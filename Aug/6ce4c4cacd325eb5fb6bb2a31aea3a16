Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African-born actress Lesley–Ann Brandt, who plays a demon bounty-hunter in American television series, Lucifer, is back home. Brandt is in the country supporting a number of NGOs in Cape Town, including the Earth Child Project which feeds hundreds of children with its vegetable gardens at schools. She said what she misses the most about the country are the people and the culture. READ: Afrikaans features in 'Lucifer' episode “What I miss the most is like you guys. My people. My mense. The culture, the language and the sense of humour. "The fact that you can be living in and among a lot of outside noise. Things that are not necessarily positive but you somehow find the positivity to do stuff like this," said Brandt. The actress said the choice to use Afrikaans as her demon language in the show was her way of remembering her country, language and people.
