JOHANNESBURG - Singer Busisiwe 'Cici' Twala's legal team will proceed with a civil lawsuit against Arthur Mafokate after he was acquitted on assault charges. Mafokate was acquitted of the charges brought against him by Cici in 2017. Cici responded to the judgment in a video posted on Instagram, telling her followers that she would not stop fighting. READ: Arthur Mafokate acquitted of assault charges "I said to you at the beginning of this journey that I would fight until the end and this is not the end. This is not going to be the narrative for us as women," said Cici. The singer also posted a statement from her lawyer. “This is the most important redress that our client seeks -- that the truth of the incident be brought to light. Accordingly, our instruction, at present, is to proceed with the civil suit previously noted,” the statement read. My fight will continue until the truth is brought to light.. #We’renotdone #Justice ✊🏾 A post shared by  Cici #Uhlalukwenza (@ciciworldwide) on Aug 28, 2019 at 9:26am PDT
