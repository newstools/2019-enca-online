Nick Kyrgios of Australia prepares to hit a return against Kyle Edmund of Great Britain during day 5 of the Rogers Cup at IGA Stadium on August 6, 2019 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. MONTREAL - Nick Kyrgios crashed back to earth with a first-round loss at the ATP Montreal Masters on Tuesday, a 6-3, 6-4 victim Briton Kyle Edmund. Two days after winning the ATP 500 series title in Washington with a burst of consistent form, the Australian court jester was unable to maintain momentum in a match delayed for 90 minutes in the second set by light rain. "I'm a little bit tired. Physically I actually feel like I'm OK," Kyrgios said after losing in 67 minutes of actual play. "Kyle played well, served well and didn't really give me any rhythm into the match at all."

"Tonight was challenging, I was actually really looking forward to playing," he added. "But I just got beaten by a better player today." Kyrgios has returned to the Top 30 for the first time since last October as a result of his solid week in the US capital. His loss was the third of the day for Australians, with Brit Daniel Evans defeating Alex de Minaur 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) and 12th seed John Isner rallying past Jordan Thompson 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (8/6).
