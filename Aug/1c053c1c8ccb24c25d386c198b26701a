National Treasury wants to cut government spending by at least R300-billion over the next three years. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Economist Duma Gqubule is warning of a recession if National Treasury cuts government's budget. "I predicted the last recession. I can tell you right now, if they go ahead with what they're planning to do, we are going to go into another recession next year." Treasury is pushing for cuts of around R300-billion to fight a contracting economy. According to reports, Treasury is seeking an initial cut of 5 percent for the 2020/21 financial year, followed by a six and seven percent cut for the following two years. It's asked departments to prepare proposals on how to reduce expenditure. READ: South Africa is close to 'junk status' from all three rating agencies. What could follow? Gqubule said if Treasury goes ahead, the country will go through a recession. “The national economy does not work like a household budget. If you increase spending as a household, you don't get more than you spend, but the government when they increase spending in the economy, there's something called the multiplier. The knock-on effects into the economy are more than the initial expenditure, sometimes up to two times and if you cut spending, there's a negative multiplier that works, your income goes down...” Gqubule said.
