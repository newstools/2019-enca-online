"It's panic and more panic from the part of the regime that's evident. They're just afraid of the situation running out of control," said Mandaza. "You can see negative implications of such actions as when it happened in August last year and January this year. The regime finds itself unable to restrain itself in the face of growing opposition," he said. Friday's demonstrations would have been the first in a series of MDC-planned rallies. The party's accusing the government of corruption and economic mismanagement.
