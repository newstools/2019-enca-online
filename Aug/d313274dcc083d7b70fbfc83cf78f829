Mboweni suggests Eskom could sell some coal-powered plants to raise R450-billion. But Mantashe says that would leave the country in the dark. READ: Scopa to keep a close eye on Eskom “It has become fashionable to attack coal," he said. "You can close all those coal power stations or sell them and sit in darkness because other sources of energy don’t produce more than 30 percent of our energy." Meanwhile, Mantashe also called for Nersa and Eskom to fall under one department. Mantashe warned that their division is counter-productive. Currently, Nersa falls under the Department of Public Enterprises. There's a growing need to reduce the country's reliance on carbon-intensive, coal-fired electricity, while the mining sector is faced with growing job losses. So how will the new department navigate these challenges? Courtesy #DStv403
