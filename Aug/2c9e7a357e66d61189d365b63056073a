Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal’s new police chief wants to be judged on actions rather than words. Khombinkosi Jula is the commissioner of a province with a notoriously high murder rate, including political killings. Last year, almost 600 more people were murdered in KwaZulu-Natal than in 2011. In those seven-years, the province’s top cop resigned amid allegations of misconduct, and two others acted in the position. Is it going to be third time lucky with Jula?

He was criticised by some there for not curbing gang violence – but violence monitor Mary De Haas says that’s not enough to write him off. “He’s got to be hard on management that doesn’t perform in the different stations or units so he’s got major challenges and whether or not he’s up to this, I intend to test it. I’m going to bring him all sorts of problems to deal with and let’s see how deals with them,” Jula said.
