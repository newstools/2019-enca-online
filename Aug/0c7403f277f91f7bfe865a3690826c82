Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg is in New York to call attention to the need for quick action to save the planet. NEW YORK - Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg took her weekly campaign for greater action on climate change to the gates of the United Nations on Friday, urging "everyone who cares about our future" to join her when world leaders gather in New York next month. Thunberg started missing school on Fridays a year ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament, sparking a global climate strike movement known as Fridays for Future. She joined 14-year-old New Yorker Alexandria Villasenor on Friday, who began picketing outside the United Nations in New York December.

Their chants included "we are unstoppable, a better world is possible" and "sea levels are rising and so are we." Thunberg will speak at a climate summit during the annual gathering of world leaders for the UN General Assembly. She sailed into New York Harbor on Wednesday in a zero-carbon emissions boat, completing a nearly 14-day journey from England.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces a climate emergency and challenged leaders to come to the 193-member United Nations next month with concrete, realistic plans on how to better tackle the emergency. "We absolutely need to keep the rise of temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius to the end of the century and to be carbon neutral in 2050 and to have a 45 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030," he told reporters.
