AfriForum's head of policy Ernst Roets. JOHANNESBURG - The Nelson Mandela Foundation says it will launch an urgent application against AfriForum's head of policy, Ernst Roets. Roets posted the old South African flag on social media hours after the Equality Court ruled against its public display. On Wednesday, Judge Phineas Mojapelo found that the gratuitous display of the old official flag of apartheid South Africa constitutes hate speech. “The Nelson Mandela Foundation will now be proceeding with an urgent application in the High Court to declare Ernst Roets in contempt of court,” the foundation said in a statement. WATCH: Gratuitous display of Apartheid flag hate speech Roets was slammed on social media for the post. The foundation argues that the “Equality Act does not protect academic displays made in bad faith. The Foundation is of the view that AfriForum's representative's actions were in bad faith and in contempt of court. It was also disrespectful to the Deputy Judge President of the High Court.” It said that AfriForium has rejected its efforts of building cohesion.
