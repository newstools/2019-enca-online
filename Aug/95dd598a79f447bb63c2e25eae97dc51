Some of the judges pulled me aside and told me I was absolutely outstanding throughout my journey, I stood there, looked at them and thought 'then why am I not in the top 12?'. "Then again I thought to myself 'God's timing is perfect'. He is never early, he is never late, he is always on time. "I did an absolutely amazing job in my eyes and in the eyes of others but something with my creator just didn't click, this wasn't it; at least not last night. So I sit here patiently, rest assured that what is mine will find me and surely then his will will be done".
