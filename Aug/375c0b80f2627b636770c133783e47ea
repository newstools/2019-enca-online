JOHANNESBURG - Seven police officers were arrested on Wednesday after a raid on illegal traders and counterfeit goods in central Johannesburg.

"Police believe the loot found in the 46 vehicles in the basement parking at Lister Building, could be the cargo that was removed the night before after the illegal traders had received a tip-off," police said in a statement. Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Elias Mawela praised his officers for the arrests. "We certainly hope that the arrest of seven of our own will prove to the people of Gauteng that we are serious about eradicating crime, even if it means arresting our own. No one is above the law."
