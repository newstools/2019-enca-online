President Cyril Ramaphosa's legal team wants certain documents in Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report into Bosasa sealed. Ramaphosa’s legal team have written to the North Gauteng High Court to request details of banks accounts linked to the CR17 campaign not be made public. READ: Public Protector deliberating after yet another court loss Ramaphosa's team is also questioning how Mkhwebane obtained the documents. "The Public Protector follows the law to the letter with each investigation she conducts,” Segalwe said. “It would not be true that she has acquired information unlawfully. She has got wide-ranging powers to obtain information for purposes of her investigation, from subpoena to search and seizure as well as to receive information from whistleblowers. “That is me speaking generally, I suppose when the matter finally makes its way to the court, those issues will be clarified for one and for all." Meanwhile, on Thursday, the court ruled in President Cyril Ramaphosa's favour by suspending Mkhwebane's instruction that he must discipline Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.
