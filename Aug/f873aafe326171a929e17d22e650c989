JOHANNESBURG - TheÂ Springboks' new blazers are certainly something to boast about. Wearing the green and gold is now all South African. South African rugby takes its responsibility very seriously. First is, of course, winning matches and tournaments and the second is nation-building. And part of this nation-building is sporting a blazer that's all local. Making sure that the Boks look their best in the green and gold, is House of Monatic. There is a call for other South African national teams to follow in the footsteps of the Springboks and wear proudly South African gear.
