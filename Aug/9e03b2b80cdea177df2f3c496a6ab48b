The decision comes amid calls for government to refine legislation on cannabis licensing. Chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa Wandile Sihlobo says the industry offers untapped opportunities to create jobs.

Sihlobo says it is important to have clear policy frameworks that will allow provinces to have the same set of rules and regulations which would govern the sale cannabis.

"Not to have certain provinces moving way ahead of other provinces. To be able to set a clear policy framework, such as, under what conditions can this be grown, what should the licensing regime be and also look at the costing."
