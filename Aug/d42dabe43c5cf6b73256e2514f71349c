Violence broke out during a raid on illegal and counterfeit goods in Johannesburg. Police said they retreated to avoid having to use live ammunition.

On selling counterfeit products, Yemane says that only a few foreign shopkeepers sell counterfeit products. Police and Gauteng's Safety and Security MEC have condemned the incident. They both warned that Home Affairs and the Department of International Relations would be roped in to deal with the matter.
