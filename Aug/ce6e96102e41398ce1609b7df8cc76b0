Couresy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A Muslim army major is considering mounting a constitutional challenge against the South African National Defence Force saying its rules are at odds with the country’s supreme law. Fatima Isaacs is facing two charges for refusing to remove her headscarf at work. Isaacs who has been in the army for ten years briefly appeared before a military court in Cape Town on Wednesday. She works as a forensic technologist at 2 Military Hospital in Cape Town but she has fallen foul of military code. READ: SANDF deployed in Cape Town townships The Legal Resources Centre has now taken over the case. Isaacs is now facing charges of wilful defiance and disobeying a lawful order. “The charges are not about wearing the headscarf,” SANDF spokesperson Mafi Mgobozi. “The charges are defying the military command. In the military, we have lawful command. If the OC has demanded you to do something and you don’t want to do it, the charges emanate from that.” READ: Mothers say army deployment is not working Isaac’s legal team says this goes beyond military code. She has never been ordered to remove her headscarf before. “They are going to have to convince us in a military court that instructing someone to remove their headscarf is in violation of her rights - the violation of her rights religiously in terms of the Constitution. How can that be lawful? Both in the military court and the constitutional court, we are going to fight it,” said labour specialist Nazeema Mohamed. Isaacs will be back in a military court in November. A Muslim army major is in a legal fight against her dismissal for refusing to remove her headscarf. Courtesy #DStv403
