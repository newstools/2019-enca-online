CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town man has come up with an innovative device allowing children with physical disabilities, the opportunity to stroll around. It will help parents give their children freedom without being burdened by heavy costs. Derek Boshard built a mobility device for his special needs daughter after buying one proved to be too expensive. The family converted a room in their home to build more Freedom Walkers so that other children too can get on their feet. Seven kids at Lonwabo Special Care Centre in Mfuleni Township have received their brand new Freedom Walkers. The Boshards hope to grow their business so that special needs children countrywide can access the walkers, putting a spring in their step as well.
