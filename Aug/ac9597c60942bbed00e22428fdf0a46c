Bess is petted by her owner as she is dried off after a hydrotherapy treatment at the Friendship Hospital For Animals in Washington. WASHINGTON - Eleven-year-old Bess waits patiently to be immersed in water just a little cooler than her body temperature. Her hydrotherapy session will last only 17 minutes but it does wonders for this arthritis sufferer. Bess is a cat. Beyond traditional veterinary treatment, the Friendship Hospital for Animals offers forms of care once reserved for humans, such as acupuncture and therapeutic ultrasound. Pets are now increasingly seen as genuine family members, said Christine Klippen, one of the 63 veterinarians who are available at the clinic every day of the year. In the United States, 84.9 million households, or 68 percent, have a pet, according to Steve King, head of the American Pet Products Association. "Millennials are the largest pet-owning demographic among all generations," he said, and have surpassed the postwar Baby Boom generation. Health care spending is the fastest-rising category as pet owners learn about available treatments. "There's less pushback than there was," said Brant Hassell, a veterinarian practicing at the District Veterinary Hospital. "These dogs are a lot of people's first children," he said. Given Washington's often oppressive summertime heat, where temperatures can easily hit 35 degrees Celsius and humidity rises to 70 percent, the animals can also exercise in relative comfort. "We can play with the speed, the water level," said Austin-Carlson. "All those things create different dynamics." But humanising pets can involve controversial or even dangerous health practices such as needlessly imposing grain or gluten-free diets on animals. This simply does not suit their nutritional needs and can cause premature death, according to Klippen. In the meantime, US authorities say they have begun scrutinising potential ties between such popular, newfangled diets and the prevalence of heart disease in dogs.
