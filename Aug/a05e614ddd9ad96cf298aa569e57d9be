Adam Catzavelos has reached a settlement with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Adam Catzavelos, who posted a racist video while on holiday in Greece,Â apologised for what he described as his disgusting behaviour. "When I watch the video, not by choice I may add but because in certain circumstances I have to, for example with my lawyers, I am truly disgusted, horrified and ashamed of my behaviour," his statement read. "I now ... am acutely aware of how profoundly dehumanizing and hurtful it must be for black South Africans to referred to by the "k" word with all its connotations, who a mere 24 years ago were liberated from centuries of enslavement, colonisation and subjugation and oppression." On Thursday, the Equality Court heard that Catzavelos had reached a settlement with the South African Human Rights Commission. He agreed to pay R150,000 over 30 months to a charitable organisation promoting social cohesion. WATCH: Being racist on social media has consequences Last year, a video of Catzavelos' video went viral on social media and in news organsations around the world. Using the k-word, he celebrated the fact that there were no black people on the beach.    Adam Catzavelos' apology for his racist video.
