Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema has accused Sanef of being nothing more than a defender of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The red berets closed their arguments in the equality court on Tuesday. WATCH: EFF says it's being made to take blame in Sanef matter Sanef is accusing the party of harassment and intimidation. The EEF wants the matter dismissed. “The matter is not between us and Sanef. The matter is between us and Pravin, they're using Sanef to come and defend Pravin. "We were speaking outside the commission against what Pravin is going to say in the commission and Sanef took offence," said Malema.
