While it's still a male-dominated industry, female rangers are among the leaders in the Kruger National Park. JOHANNESBURG - While it's still a male-dominated industry, female rangers are among the leaders in the Kruger National Park. They work long hours, cover large areas and at times, face immense danger. Lindiwe Ngobo was a field ranger for 13 years before she hung up her boots in 2013 to join the protection services in Phalaborwa.
When she joined, it was out of desperation and the need to survive.
She says when you're in the bush it's not about being a man or a woman -- it's about teamwork and having your partner's back.
