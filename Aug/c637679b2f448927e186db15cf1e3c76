There's no problem in the public health sector the National Health Insurance system can't fix. That's the claim made by Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says there's no problem in the public health sector the National Health Insurance system can't fix. Mkhize comments come despite a severe lack of hospital staff, including specialists. A 200-page report shows outreach teams didn’t even meet their target of improving care for infants and pregnant women due to a lack of paediatricians and gynaecologists. The findings were made by private consultancy firms and Wits University, following the NHI pilot projects.

It is something that can be managed and until we have a full NHI, we will be able to deal with it.” READ: Department of health forensics labs facing backlogs Mkhize also believes the alleged racial profiling of doctors by medical aid schemes will be eradicated by NHI. “Going forward into the future, there will not be a need for profiling because we are hoping NHI will embrace people who are professionals coming from various disciplines to deal with issues of health promotion. Including specialist care,” Mkhize said. The NHI Bill is before Parliament and must still be debated in the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces.
