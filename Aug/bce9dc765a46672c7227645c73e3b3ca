File: A perfect pairing can turn an ordinary meal into a wonderful occasion. JOHANNESBURG - There is no mystery to pairing food and wine, but the kingship between the two holds the key to many gastronomic pleasures. The more you allow yourself to experiment with flavour, the more interesting and challenging your food and wine world will become. A perfect pairing can turn an ordinary meal into a wonderful occasion. Tsogo Sun's Regional Sommelier Georgio Meletiou said world trends are moving boundaries, enticing people to explore new flavour combinations. "Traditionally, white wines were paired with poultry and fish and red wines with red meat," said Meletiou. "People around the world are becoming more knowledgeable and therefore more comfortable to experiment with food and wine." Meletiou has a few basic guidelines for the perfect pairing: "Don’t be afraid to try things outside your comfort zone," said Meletiou. "If it doesn’t work, learn from it. If it does work, bank it and use it in your next dinner with friends."
