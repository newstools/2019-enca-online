BUTEMBO - Three Congolese medics have been detained over the murder of a World Health Organization (WHO) doctor who was fighting an Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo, a military prosecutor said. Cameroonian doctor Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung was shot dead on 19 April in an attack on a hospital in the eastern city of Butembo. The arrested doctors will be prosecuted for "terrorism" and "criminal conspiracy," Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Baptiste Kumbu Ngoma, military prosecutor for Butembo in North Kivu province, told AFP. The three are accused of holding meetings on April 14 to plot the assassination of Mouzoko, he added.

The prosecutor said the doctors were "among the moral authors" of the attack on Mouzoko. He said one more doctor was being sought in the case. In a letter to the mayor of Butembo, the local doctors' association expressed indignation at the arrests and said they would go on strike if their colleagues were not released within 48 hours.

As a man has died, we absolutely have know the truth about what happened," the coordinator of the fight against Ebola in the DR Congo, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, told AFP. Attacks on health workers have had a devastating effect, with seven murdered and more than 50 seriously hurt, according to an unofficial tally. After the killing of Mouzoko in April, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "We will not be intimidated... we will finish our work."
