BUKAVU - Seven relatives of a gold miner who died of Ebola in eastern DR Congo have been placed under surveillance as a precaution, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The seven had sparked a scare on Wednesday after travelling from the city of Goma in North Kivu province to the town of Birava in neighbouring South Kivu -- a province that has so far escaped the year-old epidemic. The group were initially placed in quarantine along with eight people who had come to welcome them, but on Thursday South Kivu Governor Theo Ngwabidje Kasi told the press that the 15 had tested negative for Ebola.

They have been placed under surveillance with other relatives of the dead patient. "All seven were vaccinated and brought back to Goma. We put them up in a hotel last night and today we put them in an apartment to keep them there for monitoring," Dr Boubacar Diallo, coordinator of Ebola surveillance for WHO, told AFP. "So far none of the seven has displayed any symptoms."

The two deaths, occurring in a major transport hub and a border city of two million people, deepened fears the epidemic could leapfrog to neighbouring countries. The epidemic, which broke out in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018, has left 1,823 dead, according to health ministry figures released on Friday. The WHO has elevated the outbreak to a global health emergency. Health experts are especially worried when a contagious disease breaks out in a city.
