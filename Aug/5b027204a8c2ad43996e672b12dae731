That is the view of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza. Didiza met with the affected parties following weeks of tension in which farm workers were attacked and property damaged. “That is why today we said, we would listen individually to each group and we would bring them collectively to find a solution to the issue. "It may not be today, they might come up with a solution themselves. It may be that we may require an independent investigator of the issues, we don’t know as yet what the process will be”, said Didiza.

The farm was returned to its legitimate land claimants, the Mathulini Communal Property Association but it was leased to the previous owners. A group that broke away from the CPA, calling themselves 'the concerned group', is saying they are not benefiting at all. “The concerned group are challenging us on the basis that they want to run the farm, whereas they have no authority already our committee is registered in Pretoria, we've got certificates for that”, said Bhekiziwe Luthuli, inkosi of Mathulini Tribal Authority. Didiza is expected to come back here in three months' time.
