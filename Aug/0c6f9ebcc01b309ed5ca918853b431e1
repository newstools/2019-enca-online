The KZN ANC's provincial executive committee is deciding who should replace the two mayors who were sacked this week. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, hopes axed officials in the eThekwini and Msunduzi municipalities, will respect the ANC's decision. "This is about the collective. There is a need to overhaul and change the deployment, that is the view of the ANC and we support that. We will support the municipalities involved in ensuring that they continue to function effectively and provide services without disruption," Zikalala said. The party fired the entire executive committees of both municipalities, over poor performance. Among the sacked officials is former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede. Gumede has issued a statement saying she's seeking legal advice over her sacking. She insists she will not be silenced and aims to clear her name after being vilified. "I urge the members of the media and the public to wait for my public announcement in due course," a statement read.

If Gumede contests her redeployment, she'll be making an about-turn and going against a promise she made to the party executive. ANC provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli told eNCA on Tuesday that Gumede had unconditionally accepted the party's decision to remove her as mayor of eThekwini.
