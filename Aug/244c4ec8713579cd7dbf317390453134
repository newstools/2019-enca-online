Controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso during his rape and human trafficking trial at the Port Elizabeth High Court on July 31, 2019 in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa. PORT ELIZABETH - Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso has lost a court bid to force the State to provide more information on the more than 90 charges he is facing. Omotoso and his two co-accused face charges including rape, human trafficking and racketeering. Omotoso’s re-trial began in the high court sitting in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The last one collapsed when the judge recused himself due to a perceived conflict of interest. READ: NPA calls Omotoso's request a 'delaying tactic' Omotoso’s lawyer Peter Daubermann on Wednesday argued some of the charges were too vague for his clients to present an alibi but Judge Irma Schoeman dismissed the application on Thursday. Schoeman believes the details already provided are sufficient for the defence to prepare for the case. As proceedings adjourned for the day, the Home Affairs department approached Omotoso. He was informed he’s deemed a prohibited person in the country, given that he is not here on a legal passport. The trial continues on Friday.
