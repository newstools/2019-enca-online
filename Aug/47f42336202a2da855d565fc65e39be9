Red Bull KTM Ajo's Brad Binder celebrates winning the Moto2 race. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's Brad Binder turned 24 in style at the Austrian Moto2 Grand Prix. Binder, who will move to MotoGP next year, was gunning for his first win of the season. The Red Bull KTM Ajo star took the lead but had no shortage of challengers. Notably, Remy Gardner, whose desperation to get past Binder got the better of him. The Australian narrowly escaped being hit by other riders after he fell. The battle to overtake Binder led to another crash. Two more rivals fell by the wayside. Binder stayed ahead to secure victory in his team's home event. But he is well off the pace in the standings, 72 points behind championship leader Alex Marquez.
