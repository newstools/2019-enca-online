This time, Busisiwe Mkhwebane is said to be focusing on the role of senior politicians like ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule and former minister Mosebenzi Zwane. This revelation comes after the High Court on Thursday ordered Mkhwebane to pay a portion of the legal costs in her controversial Estina report, which was subsequently set aside. The court heavily slammed Mkhwebane for her initial Estina report. READ: Public Protector ordered to pay up Critics said it protected politicians, at the expense of the poor. Judge Ronel Tolmay says Mkhwebane’s conduct during the Estina investigation constituted gross negligence. “In this instance the dereliction of her duty impacted on the rights of the poor and vulnerable in society, the very people, for whom her office was essentially created.” The Public Protector denies changing findings of the provisional report to protect politicians. She says the reason she didn't expand her investigation was due to inadequate financial resources.
