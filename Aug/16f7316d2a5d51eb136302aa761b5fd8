The public won't have access to financial records of Cyril Ramaphosa's 2017 ANC presidential campaign. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa's spokesperson says she's not sure what convoluted conspiracy the EFF is trying to manufacture. The EFF on Sunday confirmed that MP Tebogo Mokwela received R40,000 from Ramaphosa "related to a bereavement".

She says if the EFF's account of what happened is true, all it proves is that the president is a caring and compassionate human being. Diko further states that Ramaphosa will not give running commentary on each payment made.
