LONDON - Meghan Markle has made a surprise appearance at a fashion shoot for her new clothing line with the London charity Smart Works, which helps long-term unemployed women look for jobs. The American former actress, who is married to Britain's Prince Harry, is a patron of the charity that provides high-quality interview clothes and interview training. Earlier this year, it was revealed she would oversee a clothing line in collaboration with the charity, to be sold in British stores. A video clip posted on the royal couple's Instagram account on Wednesday showed the 38-year-old meeting the models as they arrived for the shoot of the new workwear range - offering a sneak preview of the clothing.  Markle, who became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Harry, is already widely recognized as a champion of women's equality and empowerment. A self-declared feminist who has previously campaigned for the United Nations on gender equality, she promised last year that women's rights would be a focus of her charity work as she joined Britain's royal family. She has also won praise for her own fashion sense -- People magazine named her the best dressed woman of 2018.
