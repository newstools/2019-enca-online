The city's two biggest hospitals say they're buckling under the strain caused by violence. Almost 2,000 people have been killed by gunshots and stabbings since the beginning of the year.

"The complexity of the injuries is increasing and we are having to spend more time doing damage control surgery.” READ: Bodies pile up in Cape Town's mortuaries The provincial health department says the situation is impacting the services it can offer other patients. “Tygerberg this year already shows 107 cases per month," said Dr Beth Engelbrecht from the Western Cape Health Department. "We can’t add more resources and our staff are tremendously affected by that. They have compassion fatigue and they have to work very long hours in the time that they are there.” Doctors say it’s too soon to tell whether the army is having an impact on the number of trauma cases it’s receiving.
