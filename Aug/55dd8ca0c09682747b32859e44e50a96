The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Njabulo Nzuza visited the area to hand over identity documents. DURBAN - The Beachway informal settlement in Durban has received a swift response from the Department of Home Affairs. It provided the community with much-needed documents lost in a fire late last month. In total, 18 shacks burned down, claiming at least four lives and leaving over 30 people homeless. The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Njabulo Nzuza visited the area to hand over identity documents. Residents hope receiving these critical documents will improve their situation. "We made sure that we come here and we deliver these IDs," said Nzuza. "We understood the situation they were faced with in that they are unable to pay for their IDs, so we were able to waive that fee." The Deputy Minister says this intervention won't stop here but will be given to all those who make a claim with Disaster Management.
