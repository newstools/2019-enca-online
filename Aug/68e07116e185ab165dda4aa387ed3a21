Nick and Bobbi Ercoline, the couple from Burk Uzzle's iconic and symbolic image of Woodstock, attend the ribbon cutting ceremony of the Bindy Bazaar Trail. BETHEL - Fifty years ago, Nick and Bobbi Ercoline were just another young couple camped out at the Woodstock festival. But when a photographer snapped their picture early on that Sunday morning as they stood hugging each other while wrapped in a blanket, they unwittingly became part of pop culture history, ending up on the Woodstock festival album cover. Nick and Bobbi are still together and still living near the farm at Bethel Woods, in New York's Catskills mountains, where the three-day festival was held in 1969. The couple, now 70, say they don't remember the picture being taken nor much about what was happening around them that day on a muddy hillside strewn with sleepers huddled in blankets in the morning air. "Just getting up in the morning, standing up, giving my girlfriend a hug," Nick Ercoline recalled. "I don't even remember the picture being taken honestly." Bobbi, who was wearing large sunglasses, said she barely remembered the moment at all. But when she looks at the picture now, "I feel calmness." "I feel that it's like the birds waking up in the morning, and we're just kind of ... sorting it out. We're just waking up, looking for a nice hot cup of coffee, which there was none," she told Reuters. Nick and Bobbi married in August 1971 and went on to have two children. Bobbi worked as a school nurse and Nick became a union carpenter before retiring. They are now volunteer guides at the Bethel Woods Museum, part of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts which owns the Woodstock festival site some 160km from New York City. Museum director Wade Lawrence said the photo of the couple, taken by Burk Uzzle, captured the spirit of the festival. "It symbolises that love and togetherness of the festival. ... We're really lucky that Nick and Bobbi are still around to share their story with us," Lawrence said.
