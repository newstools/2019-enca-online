Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - The Democratic Alliance says Mamelodi Hospital in Pretoria is overcrowded, understaffed and under-equipped. DA's national and Gauteng health spokespeople, Siviwe Gwarube and Jack Bloom visited the hospital following reports that a new-born baby fell to his death – allegedly after nurses refused to help his mother. The woman allegedly gave birth standing up. Gwarube says the hospital is a death trap.

They supposed to have 12. It puts the lives of people at risk. “We are going to keep seeing these situations if we don’t lead with the root causes. If we are serious about universal healthcare, we cannot have hospitals like this which become death traps for our people,” she said.
