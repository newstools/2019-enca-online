Spokesperson for Zandile Gumede's Supporters Mzomhle Dube says the matter will now be handed over to the National level. READ: Axed eThekwini mayor insists she won't be silenced "We're not even sure how did they get to fire the mayor because I don't think that's their prerogative, but what I can rather say is that as branches we continue to actually reject dubious decisions that are being made consistently. What we want to say through to the provincial structures is that, we are branches, we have executive powers we can only agree when everything they bring to us is constitutionally correct, so we will pursue the matter with the national now because it looks like we have reached a stalemate," said Dube. The Provincial Executive Committee resolved to "redeploy" Gumede and all exco members serving in the eThekwini municipality and Msunduzi municipality. Gumede is facing fraud and corruption charges relating to a R208-million waste tender. She is out on R50,000 bail and is due back in court in January next year.
