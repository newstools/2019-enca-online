Numsa questions the appointment of Jabu Mabuza as interim Eskom CEO. JOHANNESBURG - Trade union, Numsa, wants the entire Eskom board dissolved. It argues the board is incompetent. Numsa also says board chairperson, Jabu Mabuza, should never have been appointed interim CEO. READ: Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe steps down "Its quiet strange that the Minister of Enterprises has made a decision to appoint, Jabu Mabuza as chairperson. It’s obvious that this board are clueless about running the SOE. We believe they should be removed. They don’t know how to run Eskom. We see no justification why Mabuza should hold position of chairperson and CEO. We believe he should be removed because he is conflicted," says Numsa's spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi Majola. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan picked Mabuza to be Eskom's acting CEO. It follows the resignation of Phakamani Hadebe whose tenure ended on 31 July. Mabuza will serve in the role for at least three months.
