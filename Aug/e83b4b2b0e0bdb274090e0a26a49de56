File: Joe Arpaio branded himself as "America's Toughest Sheriff" as he oversaw roundups of suspected illegal immigrants, erected tent cities to house prisoners and forced inmates to wear pink. PHOENIX - Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who built a national reputation as a staunch foe of illegal immigration, announced that he will see re-election to his old job next year. Arpaio lost a Republican primary bid in 2018 for the US Senate seat in Arizona vacated by the retirement of fellow Republican Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of US President Donald Trump. During his stint as the top elected lawman in Arizona's largest county, Arpaio branded himself as "America's Toughest Sheriff" as he oversaw roundups of suspected illegal immigrants, reinstituted chain gangs, erected tent cities to house prisoners and forced inmates to wear pink. But a federal judge cited him for criminal contempt in 2017, ruling that Arpaio had defied a 2011 court order barring his deputies from detaining Latinos solely on the suspicion that they were in the country illegally.

Still, the former sheriff ended up with less than 20 percent of the vote to finish third in the 2018 Senate primary race, trailing former state Senator Kelli Ward and then-US Representative Martha McSally, who finished first. Announcing his latest bid for office, Arpaio vowed if re-elected to bring back his tent-city and other "popular jail policies," as well as to return his controversial volunteer "posse" to its former strength. He also said he would "continue to enforce all Arizona laws that deal with drug trafficking, sex trafficking and other crimes associated with the border and illegal immigration."
