File: Cameroonian women are being trafficked to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. JOHANNESBURG - Migration appears to be the most popular resolution to individuals growing up in impoverished regions of Cameroon. With an estimated 30 percent of the country's population of 24.68 million living below the poverty line, many young Cameroonians are looking to other countries to secure a better life for themselves. Sadly, many never make it to their desired destinations often Europe as they die in their hundreds while making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean in overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels run by human traffickers. Still, others fall victim to various criminal syndicates and human trafficking rings where they are abused and exploited. READ: More than 80 people, mostly school children, kidnapped in Cameroon Enact Africa recently reported that Cameroonian women are being trafficked to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. "As the trend continues, Cameroon's unemployed women often with limited educational qualifications are still being smuggled to the Midleeast by intermediaries," said Enact. In most cases, the women are recruited through networks in Cameroon that advertise jobs for candidates through posters at universities and churches in the capital Yaoundé and another major city Douala. The victims are then entrapped in a vicious cycle which begins when they are forced to pay between $2,000 and $3,000 to various players in the human trafficking chain, leaving them in debt.
