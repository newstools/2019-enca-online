WATCH: Gratuitous display of Apartheid flag hate speech The organisation says until South Africans can work together in achieving unity it’ll all be in vain. The foundation's CEO, Sello Hatang says, "For us, this is not a victory until such time that judges concluding remarks are achieved. He pleased with all those with interest in this matter to work together to help achieve what the constitution wants us to do. I think if we're to be victorious we would have to turn 90-degrees today."

We don’t just throw insult in that pain. We are hoping to join hands with Afriforum to says let’s not poison the future by displaying the flag."
