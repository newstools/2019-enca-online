APOLLO BEACH, Florida - Scientists in Florida have artificially induced reproductive spawning of an endangered Atlantic coral species for the first time in an aquarium setting, a breakthrough they say holds great promise in efforts to restore depleted reefs in the wild. READ: Deforestation + climate change = dead end for wildlife Scientists plan to use their newly-acquired expertise to breed new coral colonies that can one day repopulate the beleaguered Florida reef system, one of the largest in the world and one decimated by climate change, pollution and disease in recent decades. "This is truly the future of coral restoration in Florida and around the world," Keri O'Neil, senior coral scientist at the Florida Aquarium, told Reuters. "We'll be able to do this for dozens of species, and it opens up a world of new possibilities." READ: Specially bred coral transplanted on Great Barrier Reef The newly cultivated corals should make for even stronger populations than existing colonies because each individual will be bred with "new genetics and new characteristics that may be more resistant to what is happening on our reefs in the future," she said. Inducing corals to release their eggs and sperm in aquarium tanks involves controlling their artificial settings to mimic their natural ocean habitat over the course of a yearlong reproduction cycle. That means carefully regulating water temperature changes from summer to winter, and using special lighting to imitate sunrise, sunset and even lunar cycles that serve as biological cues for the coral in preparing to spawn.
