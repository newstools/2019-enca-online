JOHANNESBURG - The Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation is set to resume on Monday. Former PIC boss Dan Matjila and his actions are still the focus. Proceedings were halted earlier this month due to a strike by municipal workers in Pretoria. READ: Deputy finance minister no longer PIC chairperson Government Employees Pension Fund CEO Abel Sithole told the inquiry before the postponement that the fund is doing well despite all the controversial deals the PIC has made. Sithole said it’s not reliant on the PIC as an asset manager and there should be no panic at this stage.
