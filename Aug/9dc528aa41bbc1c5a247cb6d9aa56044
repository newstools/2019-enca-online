Initially, it was suspected that food from the feeding programme at the Nelson Ngubeni Primary School had been contaminated. However, tests have shown this wasn't the case. READ: Feeding scheme at a Mpumalanga school suspended after two pupils die “Based on the samples taken from the food that is supplied at the school, there were no micro-organisms (germs) that could be linked to the foodborne illness. This means that the food from the school was safe to be consumed by the beneficiaries,” said Education MEC Bonakele Majuba. The family of one of the children who died is confident in the feeding programme and suspects something else might be to blame. Police are now investigating the snacks bought by pupils at various tuck shops The department is advising parents to speak to their children about buying food from street vendors and to refrain from giving pupils money to do so. The Mpumalanga MEC for education says investigations show food from a school where two pupils died was safe for consumption. About 13 youngsters were affected in what's suspected to have been food poisoning at Nelson Ngubeni Primary School. Courtesy #DStv403
