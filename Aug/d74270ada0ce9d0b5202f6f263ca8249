Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, says he has nothing to do with the awarding of tenders. A Sunday newspaper reported that he flouted the rules by not reporting a Huawei-sponsored trip to China as the city issued a R1-billion smart city' tender.

The tender that is out was issued on the 29th of July which is about development and maintenance of a public safety solution to the city which is closing on the 28th of August and the date I am informed has been extended to the 13th September,” said Mokgalapa. After being appointed mayor, Mokgalapa announced that the city terminated the scandal-ridden GladAfrica contract. The Auditor-General found the controversial contract wasn't above board and cost the city R1.7-billion in irregular expenditure.
