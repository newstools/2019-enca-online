This follows its two-day visit to Eskom's Medupi and Kusile power stations, which found the two plants were doomed from the start and riddled with defects. But the utility insists it can turn things around. READ: Scopa reports back after Eskom plant visits While the Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni,  suggests that debt-ridden power utility, to sell of its coal-fired power stations to raise R450-billion. However, Scopa chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa, says Eskom is not going to do that. "As far as Eskom is concerned, in a meeting that we had had, they're not in agreement with the fact that they should sell off, and that is their decision to make with the shareholder.” Scopa want the Medupi power station be completed by next year, while Kusile in the next three to four years. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts says it’s clear that the building of the Medupi and Kusile power stations was flawed from inception. Courtesy #DStv403
