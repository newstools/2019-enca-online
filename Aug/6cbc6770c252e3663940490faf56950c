JOHANNESBURG – Milutin 'Micho' Sredojević has resigned as Orlando Pirates coach. Sredojević relinquishes his position after two seasons at the helm. “The club would like to place on record that this decision was taken unilaterally, and it was the management’s decision to accept Mr. Sredojević to vacate his position based on reasons he has presented which are of a personal nature,” Pirates said in a statement. The club announced that Rhulani Mokwena will take over as head coach assisted by Fadlu Davids and Franck Plaine. Pirates suffered a 3-0 loss to SuperSport United in the Absa Premiership midweek and will look to bounce back when they face Highlands Park in the MTN 8 on Saturday.
