Courtesy of #DSTV403 CAPE TOWN - As the financial pressure on households increases, more and more pet owners can no longer afford to feed their fur babies. The SPCA is battling to cope with the number of cats and dogs being brought in and is now pleading for people to adopt pets instead of buying them. The non-profit organisation says it's a nationwide problem.
Belinda Abraham from the Grassy Park SPCA said it is a sad reality. "A lot of households are feeling the economic pinch. READ: Municipal dispute forces Uitenhage SPCA to close their doors "There's a lot of people bringing their animals in saying they can no longer afford to keep them."
It costs on average about R270 a month to feed a dog. Abraham says there's been an increase in abandoned pets after their owners have fled a house or flat while still owing rent.
While it's sad to see these animals in cages, they are the lucky ones. The Grassy Park centre can accommodate between 300 and 500 animals.
The SPCA relies completely on donations.
