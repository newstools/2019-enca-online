The Inquiry into allegations of impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation continues today. The commission will hear from businessman, Jayendra Naidoo. PRETORIA - Former trade unionist Jayendra Naidoo has testified at the PIC inquiry about the ill-fated investment into Steinhoff Africa. Naidoo said there was nothing to indicate there was anything wrong with the deal. His company, Lancaster, received over R9-billion from the PIC to buy shares in Steinhoff International.

The investment had serious implications for the PIC. It had to write off over R11-billion after Steinhoff's share price tanked when accounting irregularities came to light.

"If we had an ability to see into the fraud, then we would have valued the protection more highly and the PIC would have valued the protection more highly."
