Olympic body Sascoc remains defiant despite a government-sanctioned committee calling for organisational change. #CourtesyDStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Those hoping for government support in disputes with Sascoc over selection criteria must think again. The Olympic body has been criticised for not sending some national teams to international competitions. Sascoc maintains that due to financial constraints, it can only support teams that are realistic contenders in competitions. READ: D-day for Sascoc amid alleged mismanagement And it seems Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa is in agreement. Sascoc was back in Parliament this week -- without president Gideon Sam -- to account to the Sports Portfolio Committee. Despite being pressed by the previous administration, swift changes didn't happen at Sascoc.
There has been no news regarding board and management restructure, nor has there been a forensic audit of the organisation's finances.

Mthethwa has called for changes endorsed by the report to be carried out by the next Sascoc quadrennial meeting or by the end of the year, but that may not happen.
Despite the lack of action, Minister Mthethwa says he remains confident there is commitment to follow through on the report. “There's always going to be an issue with Sascoc because everybody would want to say that they want to gain experience," he said.
