Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - There are questions about the suspension of SA Express that remain unanswered on Friday. The airline's flights were grounded on Wednesday due to operational reasons. The suspension has now been lifted and the company is refusing to speak at this point. READ: SA Express under scrutiny at state capture inquiry The Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) said SA Express may resume flights after the airline partially paid its debt. SA Express is promising to pay the balance of about R70-million by Monday.
Acsa said representatives of both companies met to resolve the matter. SA Express owed outstanding passenger service charges and landing and parking fees. READ: Turbulent SA Express grounded over safety On Friday, SA Express' interim CEO Siza Mzimela told MPs during an oversight visit that the grounding of flights were due to historic challenges, including a weak balance sheet, long outstanding debt and a significant monthly cash bill.
Acsa said it regrets the suspension, but that it was necessary to ensure fairness to all airlines. SA Express has also this week been a topic at the state capture inquiry regarding suspicious payments to some companies.
