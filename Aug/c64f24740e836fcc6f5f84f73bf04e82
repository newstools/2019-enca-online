Miss Venezuela 2019 contestants pose for pictures during a press conference. CARACAS -Â For the first time in its history, the Miss Venezuela contest will not publish the 24 contestants' waist, bust and hip measurements, as pageants face criticism for their primary focus on physical appearance. The event, which will take place in Caracas on Thursday, has been running since 1952 and has an enviable record on the international stage, having produced seven Miss Universe winners and six in Miss World. Traditionally, the contestants' vital statistics have been publicised -- with a 90-centimetre bust, 60-centimetre waist and 90-centimetre hips long considered the ideal.

"A woman's beauty isn't 90, 60, 90 ... It is measured by each one's talent," said Gabriela Isler, the pageant's spokeswoman and Venezuela's last Miss Universe winner in 2013. At past pageants, presenters would tell the audience the exact size of each contestant, many of whom underwent cosmetic surgery and followed strict diets in a bid to achieve the supposedly ideal physique.
