Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former members of the Economic Freedom Fighters have launched a new political party. The new political party, the African Federal Convention (Afco) is led by Vusi Mathe, a former EFF MP in KwaZulu-Natal. WATCH: EFF celebrates 6th anniversary Mathe said he allowed his EFF membership period to lapse in 2017 because of problems he had with the leadership. He stated in an interview with eNCA that the EFF did not adequately prioritise the use of African languages particularly in schools. "Our children are being taught in the wrong languages, in foreign languages," he said. Mathe expanded on some of the party's positions, including decentralising some government powers to the provincial government. He specified the Western Cape would be granted their own powers of judiciary in order to resolve the issue of widespread and escalating crime. The party claims to have 10,000 members across the country.
