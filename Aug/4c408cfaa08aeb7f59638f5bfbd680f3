While the City of Cape Town welcomes the launch of the National Tourism Safety Awareness Campaign, a City official says more needs to be done. CAPE TOWN -  The City of Cape Town welcomed the launch of the National Tourism Safety Awareness Campaign this week. The initiative follows the recent murder of a Ukranian hiker, along with other isolated incidents involving tourists on Table Mountain. The campaign sees an increase in the number of so-called Tourism Monitors, and the addition of more cameras and possibly drones later this year. Cape Town Safety and Security mayoral committee member JP Smith says it's not so simple to police one of Cape Town's most recognisable landmarks.

You've got an infinite number of access points, and the people you're looking for easily blend with other hikers. It's very hard to profile the person unless they look slightly out of place,” Smith said. Smith says visitor safety in the Park is the responsibility of the police and SANParks. The City is exploring deploying trained law enforcement officers to the Park, and depending on resources, also to the Cape Flats.
