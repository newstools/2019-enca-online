JOHANNESBURG - Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus confirmed that a complaint has been laid against Eben Etzebeth at the Human Rights Commission. This is in relation to an incident in Langebaan which led to Etzebeth being accused of assault. The lock denies any wrongdoing and remains a key part of the Bok World Cup plans. "I have to believe what a player tells me and until something else is proven, only then we can act," said Erasmus. The coach said Etzebeth and player affairs manager Eugene Henning met with the HRC. “They are there in discussions at the HRC on exactly what the claim is. But there is no police or any other thing that we’ve heard.” South African Rugby issued a statement in support of Etzebeth. The Springboks depart for Japan on Friday.
