Equal Education General Secretary Noncedo Madubedube has commented on the sexist tweets released by the spokesperson of the Department of Education's spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga. Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Basic Education has condemned what it describes as sexist tweets by its spokesperson. Minister Angie Motshekga has in a statement distanced herself from the controversial tweets posted by Elijah Mhlanga.
Mhlanga posted provocative images of women on his account to promote reading. He then proceeded to tag the department's account, using the hashtag read to lead. Motshekga has slated the posts, saying they're a clear sign of male chauvinism and an objectification of women. She says this has no place in society.

The organisation responded to his sexist tweets, Equal Education suggested he read The Will to Change: Men Masculinity & Love by bell hooks, We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Sister Outsider by Audre Lorde. Equal Education General-Secretary Noncedo Madubedube said Mhlanga should possibly attend sensitivity training and read more widely himself. Madubedube extended an invitation to the Department of Basic Education, asking them to all the NGO to provide them with information and training on issues of intersectionality and feminism. Section27 has also condemned the tweets.
