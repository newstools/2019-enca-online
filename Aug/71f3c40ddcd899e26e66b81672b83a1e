WATCH: Amla retires from international cricket The statistical highlights are almost too many to relate. He has made South Africa’s only Test triple century to date and has made the highest Test scores for his country against England, India and the West Indies and the highest against Australia in the post-unity period.

Amla made 490 runs and was only dismissed once in the two-match Test series in India in 2010, scoring centuries in both innings of the second match to follow his unbeaten double century in the first and earned Man of the Series honours in both the Test and ODI series in England in 2012. His innings of 196 against Australia at Perth the same year won him the Man of the Match award and was an important contribution to the Proteas series-winning performance. This resulted in his becoming the No. 1 ranked batsman in the world in Test cricket in 2013.

Amla's ODI career was equally successful as he was ranked among the best batsmen in this format for an extended period of time for much of that period having an average in excess of 50 and a strike rate of 100 and has been the quickest batsman to reach the landmarks of 2 000, 3 000, 4 000, 5 000, 6 000 and 7 000 runs in the format. He also holds the SA record of 27 ODI centuries.
