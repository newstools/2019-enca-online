The Commission hopes he'll give more clarity on the failed Estina dairy farm project. Thabethe's name has come up several times in the testimony from other witnesses on the Estina project. As HOD, he was the accounting officer at the time of the failed Gupta-linked dairy project that was meant to empower emerging black farmers in the eastern Free State. It's fair to say that a lot of the answers he gave left the chairperson and evidence leader with a lot more questions.
