Riot police patrol the streets after police earlier banned planned protests by the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in Harare. HARARE - Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party succumbed on Friday to pressure from what it labelled a fascist government, calling off a street protest as armed police set up roadblocks and barred access to its Harare offices. Police and armed soldiers searched buses, taxis and private vehicles at checkpoints and randomly asking for identity documents. More than a hundred opposition supporters chanted party slogans and sang near a square in central Harare where protesters had been set to assemble but were chased away by baton-wielding police.
