File: In a series of postings on Twitter, Miley Cyrus said she had nothing to hide. LOS ANGELES - Pop star Miley Cyrus said she was no angel, but angrily denied rumours she had cheated on her estranged husband, actor Liam Hemsworth. In a series of postings on Twitter after Hemsworth filed for divorce after just seven months of marriage, the 26-year-old singer said she had nothing to hide. "You can say I am a twerking, pot-smoking, foul-mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar,” the "Wrecking Ball" singer wrote. "I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating," she said. Hemsworth and Cyrus announced through a representative earlier this month that they had separated, shocking fans of the former Disney Channel child star and leading to rumours and speculation in celebrity media about the cause. Cyrus tweeted that although she would always love Hemsworth, who she met 10 years ago and married in December 2018, she "had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind."
