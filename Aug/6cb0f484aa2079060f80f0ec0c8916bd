File: Sassa says any innocent and affected beneficiaries whose payments have been stopped, are advised to make an affidavit at the police station. JOHANNESBURG - Sassa says it has stopped 6 000 payments with the figure substantially going down to 500 in the August payment cycle. Sassa says the move was to combat the prevalent grant fraud targeting social grants. It says the decline is as a result of stringent measures put in place to combat fraud by both Sassa and the Post Office. “An intensive process of studying the trends was embarked upon and the modus operandi of the fraudsters was exposed,” Sassa said in a statement. “Subsequently systems and controls were tightened. We can confidently say that the noose has tightened on these criminals and the law will deal harshly with them. In the recent past, the courts have not only sentenced people found guilty of social grant fraud but has issued orders for them to repay what they stole from the State.” READ: 2,800 Sassa accounts frozen after fraud suspected Sassa says any innocent and affected beneficiaries whose payments have been stopped, are advised to make an affidavit at the police station. “The affidavit should confirm the correctness of bank details and account holder details,” Sassa said. “After making an affidavit, a beneficiary must take their barcoded or smart card ID together with the completed affidavit to SASSA or the post office. Those using personal banks must bring along proof of banking details from their banks. SASSA wishes to apologise unreservedly for any convenience that might arise.”
