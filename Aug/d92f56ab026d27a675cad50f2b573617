Cele said the police ministry has been in conversation with the liquor board about rules and regulations surrounding shebeen owners, and that this is being done in order to ensure residents are in safe surroundings. “Illegal shebeens should be all shutdown,” Cele said. “Any shebeen that is there and people die in their premises becomes illegal.” “We are in constant contact with the liquor board.” Cele has again warned gangsters that their days are numbered. He visited the Mitchells Plain Base Camp to receive a report on the deployment of troops there. It's been several weeks since the army was deployed to gang hotspots across Cape Town.

Western Cape Safety MEC, Albert Fritz, has acknowledged the army's presence is making a difference. Cele reiterated that communities have to cooperate with law enforcement to put an end to crime. “Criminals, particularly gangsters and gang leaders your days are numbered,” Cele said. “As the law enforcement arm, we realize that so much still needs to be done with community members working with us, we are confident of turning the corner in our quest to create safer communities.”
