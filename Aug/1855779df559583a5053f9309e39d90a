File: Judge Letty Molopa-Sethosa said, in her view, President Cyril Ramaphosa has taken a rational decision. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa's urgent application to interdict Public Protector Busiswe Mkhwebane’s remedial action has succeeded. Judge Lettie Molopa-Sethosa handed down judgment on Thursday. Molopa-Sethosa said Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan are correct in saying that there is no consistency in implementing Mkhwebane’s remedial action pending judicial review. "In my view, the president has taken a rational decision," she said. She said Ramaphosa has made a case for the orders that he has sought. LIVESTREAM: High Court to rule on Ramaphosa, Mkhwebane case Molopa-Sethosa detailed Mkhwebane's report which found that Gordhan violated the Constitution. Ramaphosa argued he doesn’t want to discipline Gordhan immediately, as directed by Mkhwebane. He felt it was inappropriate to take disciplinary action against Gordhan until legal processes were concluded.

"It is not contentious that the President has indeed taken note of the findings of the report," she said. "The Public Protector self accepts that the President has taken note of the findings of her report when it comes to Minister Gordhan."
