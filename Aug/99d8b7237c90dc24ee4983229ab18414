Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – The ANC is rubbishing leaked emails on President Cyril Ramaphosa's campaign as nothing but a calculated maneuver to undermine public confidence in him. The party says it’s not aware of any illegal acts in campaigns conducted by any leader including Ramaphosa. Leaked emails published in weekend media reports suggest Ramaphosa was in the loop about the CR17 campaign funding for his ANC presidency bid, despite his previous denials. “The ANC has however noted the public interest and other issues that have arisen relating to the funding of internal campaigns towards the 54th National Conference held at Nasrec, Johannesburg in December 2017,” the party said in a statement. “In this regard, the ANC welcomes actions taken by President Ramaphosa who has acted openly and transparently by providing a detailed account to the Public Protector on these matters. “The ANC is not aware of any acts of illegality on the part of a campaign conducted by any leader of the ANC, including President Ramaphosa.” READ: 'Ramaphosa should've come clean': Analyst The ANC further said that the leaked emails are a strategy to distract from dealing with the challenges of South Africa’s economy. “The leaked emails are therefore nothing but a calculated maneuver to defocus and detract from the immediate task of socio-economic issues and dealing with the challenges of our economy,” the party said. “This is also an attempt to undermine public confidence in President Ramaphosa whose leadership has been defined by moral and ethical conduct. “In discharging his leadership responsibilities, President Ramaphosa has always placed reliance on the counsel he gets from his party, the African National Congress.”
