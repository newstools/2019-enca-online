JOHANNESBURG - South African teenager Adam Sissison is showing others the importance of embracing other cultures by learning their languages and dances. Sission, who has been trending on social media after posting a video of himself doing an indigenous XiTsonga dance, says he wants people to realise the importance of diversity and understanding each other."As far back as I can remember, maybe 7 or 8, I used to listen to Yvonne Chaka Chaka and Brenda Fassie like Mqombothi and Vulindlela. I love it so much," said Adam. WATCH: Esther Mahlangu honoured with French accolade Adam says he is learning to speak different languages through music and so far he can sing in 10 dialects including Tshivenda, IsiZulu, Shona and Nama. However, he says the XiTsonga way of life has resonated with him the most."I really love the XiTsonga culture and language. I saw them do Xibelani and I was like I need it. "But as you know the Tsonga people are very small group in South Africa, so I had to do a bit of searching to find the Xibelani." He says even though there are some who some criticise him, he hopes he can inspire people to be open-minded and embrace unity.
