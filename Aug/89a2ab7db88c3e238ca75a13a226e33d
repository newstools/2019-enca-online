Although Organ Donor Month is drawing to a close, doctors are appealing to South Africans to consider organ donation.

Although Organ Donor Month is drawing to a close, they're appealing to South Africans to consider organ donation as the need is constant. Dr Peter Nourse of the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital says due to the shortage of organs, they often have to make tough decisions, like turning patients down for transplants.
