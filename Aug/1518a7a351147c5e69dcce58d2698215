Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Enoch Nkwe’s astonishing success in his first season as coach of the Lions has been rewarded. Nkwe has been named interim Proteas Team Director ahead of the tour to India and is the first black coach to be put in charge of the Proteas. His role as caretaker comes on the back of three trophies in less than a year with the Lions. While his appointment is a significant moment for black cricket, his fellow coaches say his results speak for themselves. “Besides the fact that he’s black, he’s a good coach, that happens to be black. He’s proven his worth over the past year, and he’s been coaching for a long time," said Titans assistant coach, Mandla Mashimbyi.

Meanwhile, at just 36, the Soweto-born Nkwe is part of a growing breed of young coaches in the country. Nkwe’s tenure begins on an interesting note without the services of senior players JP Duminy, Hashim Amla and Dale Steyn. The series against India gets underway on September 15.
