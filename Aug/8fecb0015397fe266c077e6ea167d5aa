The DA has written to National Speaker, Thandi Modise to express its opposition to the Bill. “At its very core, the NHI Bill seeks to fundamentally alter healthcare policy in South Africa by creating a State-Owned Entity (SOE) to consolidate all funds within the public and private health system. This is the nationalisation of all healthcare in SA. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize himself admitted that medical aids will most likely cease to exist under NHI,” Maimane said. WATCH: The NHI will help everyone: Mkhize “It is our view that in its current form, the NHI Bill will not bring about universal healthcare but will consolidate power, cripple the private health sector and collapse our economy. At a conservative estimated cost of over R250 billion, the NHI is to the health sector what Zuma’s nuclear deal would have been to the energy sector,” he added. The party said it's prepared to fight the Bill all the way to the Constitutional Court. Maimane says the implementation of the National Health Insurance will take away powers from provinces. The party says it will do anything in its power to stop the implementation of the NHI. Courtesy #DStv403
