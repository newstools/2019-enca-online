A fire gutted the Grand Station Hotel, leaving the iconic structure a mere shell of what it used to be. JOHANNESBURG - Built in 1896, the Grand Station Hotel has been a respected landmark in Jeppestown, Johannesburg. A fire gutted the 123-year-old building, leaving the iconic structure a mere shell of what it used to be. Local community members say residents hurled their belongings out of windows as the fire ripped through. There's even claims that some attempted to loot the burning building. The Grand Station Hotel was built in 1896 and received protection in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act in 1986. It initially served miners from the nearby Wolhunter mine. The building also housed the popular Norman's Grill in the 1960s and 1970s, which was renowned for its prawns and drew businessmen from all over Johannesburg. Before the fire, it housed several shops and 38 residential rooms. Just last year, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba revealed that officials managed to prevent the hotel from being hijacked.
