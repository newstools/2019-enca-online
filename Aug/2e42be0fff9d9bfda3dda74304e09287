The National Health Insurance bill has been introduced to Parliament and aims to provide healthcare to all South Africans, and designated foreigners. But exactly how will this ambitious project be rolled out, and crucially, how much will it cost the taxpayer? Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize has attempted to allay fears that National Health Insurance (NHI) will require extra funding at the implementation phase.

Among those who are critical of the NHI is the chair of Social Security at Wits School of Governance, Professor Alex van den Heever. Van den Heever insisted the NHI will not work.

Van den Heever stated two bodies are dependent on ministerial appointments. “The key areas of corruption in our system at the moment are appointment of staff. All of our SOEs have that framework and that's why they've all failed and been captured... Why would this fund be different?” READ: Proposed new health laws will help the poor: Sanco The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa and the South Africa Medical Association are among those supporting the NHI. “We welcome the long-awaited health bill because we think it is long overdue, it talks to what nurses are doing on a daily basis. It talks about engineering of primary health care,” said Denosa's Kwena Manamela.
