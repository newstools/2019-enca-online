Palesa Madiba, a UJ student went missing in 2013. JOHANNESBURG - Women from the EFF have marched to various locations in Gauteng, including the Commission for Gender Equality and the Public Protector's office. They are calling for swift justice in the Palesa Madiba murder case. The matter was postponed in the Protea Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday to allow the accused to secure legal representation. The EFF says the system is failing women, particularly in sexual harassment, rape and abuse cases. It's demanding that the National Prosecuting Authority puts 70 percent of its resources into such cases and into victim-support. This would include safe places and psycho-social support for victims. The EFF’s provincial chairperson, Mandisa Mashego, says they are questioning why it took the police over two years to find Madiba’s body, and almost six years to arrest her alleged killer. Madiba, a University of Johannesburg student, went missing in August 2013. Acting on a tip-off, police finally discovered her skeleton in a shallow grave in Phiri, Soweto in December 2015.
