To drink or not to drink - that's the question Hammanskraal residents continue to grapple with every day, as doubts remain on the quality of their drinking water. JOHANNESBURG - Was the water supplied in Hammanskraal fit for human consumption? That's what the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will be probing in its inquiry into water pollution challenges in the City of Tshwane. The probe follows negative water test results. READ: Hammanskraal residents' water woes continue The HRC is also widening an investigation into the treatment of people in Hammanskraal after tests found the water unfit for human consumption. The SAHRC began its probe into the water pollution in the city after negative water results were found by the CSIR in Hammanskraal. The results indicated the presence of toxins that could cause cancer as well as other acute illnesses. The commission's Buang Jones said, "The water has been declared unsafe for human consumption by a reputable institution, the CSIR." WATCH: A water disaster in the making The SAHRC has asked the municipality to provide the people of Hammanskraal with potable water immediately. They are in the process of simplifying their report in order to communicate effectively with the community. The investigation has been expanded to report on other failures to provide basic services to the people of Hammanskraal.
