The process to rename schools like Hoërskool Hendrik Verwoerd and General Smuts High School is ongoing. Lesufi says this will help towards building a new South Africa. The MEC adds that consultations to reach a suitable name are fair and inclusive.

"The classroom should be a centre where our children learn to play and dance together, but if you want some section of society to monopolise education, it’s not future for our country.” Government is determined that all names associated with the apartheid and colonial-era must be changed.
