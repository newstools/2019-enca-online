Kaitano Tembo coach of Supersport United during the 2019 MTN8 Supersport United Press Conference. JOHANNESBURG - SuperSport United will be looking to reach their third consecutive MTN8 final when they play their arch-rivals Mamelodi Sundowns in two-legged semi-finals. United reached the last four of the top eight after thrashing Bidvest Wits 3-0 on Sunday. On-form striker Bradley Grobler was once again in the scoresheet while fellow striker Thamsanqa Gabuza netted a brace for United. United's coach Kaitano Tembo admitted that it won't be an easy challenge to play a Tshwane derby in a cup competition, but he's hoping his boys will go all the way to lift the title after failing to win it last season.
