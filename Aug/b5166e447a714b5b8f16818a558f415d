Babadi Tlatsana in June testified how her business was hijacked and used as a conduit to channel state funds. The inquiry's been informed she’d previously lodged an intimidation case with police, who allegedly did nothing.

The R51-million contract would see her handle baggage services at two North West airports. But she had neither the skills nor the experience for that job. Van Wyk allegedly hijacked her accounts and millions flowed into and out of her company, almost immediately.

On 4 January 2018, Tlatsana lodged a case of intimidation with North West police after she stopped the rampant payments. After giving evidence before the inquiry, her attorney says unknown men approached her family looking for her and also tried to get into her house. In the meantime, Tlatsana’s whereabouts remain unknown, even to her attorney.
