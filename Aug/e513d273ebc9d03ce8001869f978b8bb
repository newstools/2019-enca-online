The City of Tshwane says it will have to take action following an 18 percent pay rise for senior managers. PRETORIA - The City of Tshwane says it will have to take action against those who processed an 18 percent pay rise for senior managers without following the rules. This as the city prepares to cough up around R380-million to meet the demands of municipal workers who wanted the same increase. Thousands of employees staged a four-day-long strike that brought parts of the capital to a standstill this week.
