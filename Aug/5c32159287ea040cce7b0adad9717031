Busisiwe Mkhwebane wanted Ramaphosa to implement her remedial action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. It relates to the pension payout and rehiring of former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. “We will be taking this judgment, together with the judgement of [Juge Sulet] Potterill on appeal because as you know, the two judgments literally are going against the tide of an established principle by Constitutional Court that the remedial action by Public Protector are no mere remedial action and they are binding until they are set aside by the court of law,” said EFF spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. WATCH: High Court rules on Ramaphosa, Mkhwebane case "And mere application of review does not set them aside. You can only set them aside through an urgent interdict on exceptional circumstances. You and I were in court today when the judge was struggling to read her own judgment, not even in one moment did she substantiate what are the exceptional circumstances in this case...” added Ndlozi. Meanwhile, Mkhwebane's office says it will study the judgment before deciding whether or not to appeal. In addition, Judge Letty Molopa-Sethosa ordered Mkhwebane and the EFF to pay Ramaphosa's legal costs. The High Court has granted President Cyril Ramaphosa's application to suspend the public protector's remedial action against minister Pravin Gordhan.
