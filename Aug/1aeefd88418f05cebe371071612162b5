The SABC's TV blackout of premier soccer coverage has spread to radio, leaving millions of soccer-loving South Africans in the lurch after the broadcaster this week told radio stations to cancel any coverage or commentary of the Absa premiership, Karima spoke to the broadcaster’s board chair Bongumusa Makhathini about this. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African soccer fans without access to DStv will have to look for alternatives as the SABC continues to negotiate to broadcast PSL matches. Speaking to eNCA on Karima Brown's show, The Fix, SABC chairperson, Bongumusa Makathani, said the SABC at this stage do not have an agreement with the Premier Soccer League because they haven't been able to agree on commercial terms. "At this stage we still don't have any agreement with the PSL, because we haven't been able to agree on commercial terms. In terms of what we are able to and what makes commercial sense for the SABC and what they are expecting, we haven't been able to find each other," said Makhathini.

The broadcaster is reported to have cancelled all commentary and coverage on games on its radio stations. The embattled public broadcaster has been struggling to secure broadcasting rights for local PSL games. The PSL is now on its second week for the 2019/2020 season.
