The minister posted a video on his twitter account on Thursday afternoon eating a bunny chow. In the video he jokes: "Eating a bunny chow in Durban is better than the Gupta curry". READ: Gupta curry never finished me, I stood firm: Mbalula Earlier this year, Mbalula told the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that the Guptas had offered him curry. "They offered me some curry there before we could talk. I think it is their culture that before you talk to them, they give you curry. "Then he gave me a good lecture about all the things that I eat are from their farm. So that's what we discussed but that curry never finished me; I stood firm." Mbalula and the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) were in Durban conducting a pre-departure inspection at the Transnet Freight Rail yard on Thursday when he posted the video to Twitter.
