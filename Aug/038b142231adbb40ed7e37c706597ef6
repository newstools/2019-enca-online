 Trevor Mallard, speaker in the country's House of Representatives, posted an image on his Twitter page of him feeding MP Tamati Coffey's newborn son while in the speaker's chair. WELLINGTON - As New Zealand lawmakers vigorously debated fuel prices in Parliament this week, speaker Trevor Mallard called for order while feeding baby Tūtānekai his bottle. The six-week-old son of Labour MP Tāmati Coffey and his husband, born via a surrogate mother last month, was being cuddled by his father in the debating chamber when the speaker offered to hold him. "There are times when I can be vaguely useful," Mallard told Reuters, adding that he tried to help care for lawmakers' babies when possible. The newborn joins many other babies in the legislature after Mallard relaxed rules in 2017 to make Parliament more child-friendly. READ: Fathers with newborns now have more leave days About a dozen MPs have had infants in a parliamentary baby boom, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last year became New Zealand's first premier to take maternity leave and the world's second elected leader to give birth in office. Her daughter Neve Te Aroha made headlines in September when she accompanied Ardern to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mallard, a political veteran, and father of three adult children, with six grandchildren, hoped more employers would follow his lead. "What I've found is that it adds to the positive atmosphere of the workplace," he said, adding that he regularly encountered babies in the halls of power and even the indoor parliamentary swimming pool.
