A witness in El Paso, Texas, describes helping children evacuate Cielo Vista Mall after hearing multiple gunshots. EL PASO - Witnesses said the gunman who killed 20 people on Saturday at a packed Walmart store in Texas, appeared to be shooting at random when he opened fire around 10.30am. One woman, who gave her name as Vanessa, said she had just pulled into the Walmart parking lot when the shooting began. "You could hear the pops, one right after another and at that point as I was turning, I saw a lady, seemed she was coming out of Walmart, headed to her car. She had her groceries in her cart and I saw her just fall," she told Fox News. The witness said the gunman wore black t-shirt, combat trousers and was wearing earmuffs. "He was just shooting randomly. It wasn't to any particular person. It was any that would cross paths." Another shopper described how he managed to avoid being hit by hiding along with his mother between two vending machines just outside the store. "That's where the individual tried to shoot at me, which he missed cause I kind of ducked down," Robert Curado told the El Paso Times.
