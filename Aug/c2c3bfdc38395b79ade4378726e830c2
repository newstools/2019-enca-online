Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Only one out of every 10 dogs born finds a home. That’s according to animal welfare organisation - Rescue Rehab South Africa.

To celebrate International Homeless Animals Day, dog lover came in numbers. WATCH: Dog poisoning on the rise, expert says Dog lover Joanne Lefson said the aim of this initiative was to break the world record for the most dogs adopted in a single day. “This is all about taking dogs from shelters and bringing them to people where they can be seen.

This really just shows them in the best possible way that shelter dogs are amazing, they are healthy, they are happy dogs,” she said.
