Australia's David Warner plays a shot on the opening day of the first Ashes cricket Test match between England and Australia. BIRMINGHAM - Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss and decided to bat in the first Ashes Test against England at Edgbaston on Thursday. Ashes-holders Australia have not won a match of any kind at Edgbaston since 2001, while England have won their past 11 internationals at the Birmingham ground. Australia are looking for their first Ashes series win in England in 18 years. "The wicket looks nice and hard and dry," said Paine at the toss. "Hopefully we post a good total and we've got (off-spinner) Nathan Lyon up our sleeve at the back end of the game." As expected, the visitors included all three players given lengthy bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year -- David Warner, Cameron Bancroft and former captain Steve Smith. READ: Du Plessis, Van der Dussen star against Australia Openers Bancroft and Warner knew they would be booed on their way to the middle, judging by the hostile reception Warner and top-order batsman Smith received during the recent World Cup in England and Wales. They did not have to wait even that long to face the boo-boys, with the Australia team as a whole jeered onto the field for a pre-match anthem ceremony -- an unusual occurrence before a Test match in England. Reserve wicketkeeper Matthew Wade was included as a specialist batsman after making three hundreds for Australia A on their tour of England. The Edgbaston match is the first of a five-Test series and the first of the ICC's new World Test Championship, with players' names and squad numbers displayed on the backs of their shirts for the first time in this format.
