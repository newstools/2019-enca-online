JOHANNESBURG - Documents obtained by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane about the CR17 campaign has been filed at the High Court. Mkhwebane's evidence relates to a R500,000 Bosasa donation. She has not disclosed how the evidence -- including bank statements and email correspondence from various funders -- was obtained. President Cyril Ramaphosa's legal team last week wrote to the North Gauteng High Court to request that details linked to banks accounts intended for the CR17 campaign not be made public. READ: Ramaphosa CR17 emails leaked News24 published details of what it says are leaked emails between Ramaphosa and his campaign manager ahead of his ANC presidential campaign of 2017. Mkhwebane made reference to emails when she found that Ramaphosa misled Parliament about the source of the Bosasa donation to his campaign. Ramaphosa says he wasn't entitled to donations made to his ANC presidential campaign and, therefore, couldn't declare them as his own in Parliament.
