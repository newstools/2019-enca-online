You might need to mind your tongue a bit if you plan on visiting the beach in Cape Town, in future. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cape Town beachgoers might have to mind their tongue or risk being fined. The City of Cape Town says the by-law is intended to manage public access and social behavior along the coast. The proposed by-law states clearly that no one making use of coastal zones may use foul language. READ: A moment of madness: Catzavelos on k-word rant Mayoral Committee Member, Marian Nieuwoudt, says the by-law is to control unruly behaviour on beaches. Nieuwoudt also said should the proposed by-law come into law, there will be enforcement. “We need to manage the conflict of everybody that needs to exercise their activities on the beach. So the law enforcement will be trained and they will be mandated to enforce the by-law.” The bill is still in a draft form and will need the full council’s approval before it becomes law.
