File: The strike occurred 28 minutes after play was halted when thunderstorms hit the East Lake Golf Club. ATLANTA - Six spectators were injured when lightning struck a tree during the third round at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Saturday. The strike occurred 28 minutes after play was halted when thunderstorms hit the East Lake Golf Club, Tour rules official Mark Russell said on the NBC broadcast. The PGA Tour said two lightning strikes had hit the course. "(Emergency personnel) tended to those fans and two others immediately and transported them from the property via ambulance for further medical attention," the Tour said in a statement. "Our latest report is that their injuries do not appear to be life-threatening." Russell said officials were aware of possible thunderstorms but elected not to change the tee-times. "When one did form right over the top of us we suspended play immediately," he said. NBC screened footage showing the lightning bolt that apparently caused the injuries. Professional golf tournaments became far more vigilant about stopping play amid the threat of lightning after two spectators were killed at separate major championships in the United States in 1991. While players and caddies are loaded into vehicles and taken back to the clubhouse in such situations, fans are left to seek their own shelter, and may lack the time to leave the course safely or choose not to do so.
