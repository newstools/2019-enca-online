Heiron Joseph has found solace and success in creating the most incredible paintings. CAPE TOWN - It's been nearly 15 years since Heiron Joseph faced the darkest day of his life. A diving accident that left him paralysed forever. But even in the face of adversity, this 40-year-old survivor is pursuing his passion - creating the most incredible paintings using just his mouth.
Heiron says it's taken a bit of time to master his unique style of painting.
"It's a combination of both your palette and your teeth and then obviously your neck plays a major a role because you've got to steady the whole process with your neck," he said. Heiron is currently working on four pieces commissioned by one of the biggest ad agencies in the country.
