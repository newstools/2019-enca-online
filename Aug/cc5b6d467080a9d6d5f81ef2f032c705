READ: Health Minister confident in NHI It was adopted by Cabinet last month, and still needs to be debated in the National Assembly. Mkhize said there will never be a perfect time to implement the NHI. He believes it will go a long way in improving the country's ailing health system. READ: Government to fight for NHI, says Motsoaledi "The reality is that if you look at the nature of health services, there is a lot of work that needs to be done. "We can still do a lot even in the absence of the number of specialists that have been reported," he said. "You can get a cover from specialists in a way that would not compromise the health services. "It is something that can be managed and until we have a full NHI, we will be able to deal with it," the minister exhorted. There's no problem in the public health sector the National Health Insurance system can't fix. That's the claim made by Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize. Courtesy #DStv403
