File: Former NPA deputy prosecutions boss, Nomgcobo Jiba JOHANNESBURG - Beleaguered former NPA deputy prosecutions boss, Nomgcobo Jiba, has scored a small victory. Parliament has agreed not to continue with its discussion on whether the president was correct in firing her until she returns to court next month. Jiba had sought an urgent interdict on Wednesday to stop Parliament from considering the matter until a review application is heard. WATCH: Temporary reprieve for Nomgcobo Jiba Parliament’s Justice Committee is fast approaching its 30-day deadline to determine whether Jiba and her former colleague, Lawrence Mrwebi, should be reinstated. As a result, it's been reluctant to halt its proceedings. But, Jiba’s lawyer has confirmed to eNCA that by mutual agreement, Parliament will now hold off for the time being. WATCH: Jiba seeks interdict to stop Parliamentary process on reinstatement Jiba's asking the court to set aside the findings of the Mokgoro Inquiry, which recommended she be axed. She also wants to be reinstated to her job and for her post not to be advertised until the court has considered her application.
