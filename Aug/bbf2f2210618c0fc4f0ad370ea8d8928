The international dance production "Burn the Floor" is returning to South Africa. CAPE TOWN - The international dance production Burn the Floor is returning to South Africa. But this time it has a bit of local flavour. The show has produced a uniquely South African dance routine that will have you tapping your feet. It has incorporated the late Miriam Makeba's Pata Pata, celebrating the late musical icon on her own doorstep. Dancers were able to incorporate the Pata Pata, loosely translated as “touch touch”, in a high energy Cha Cha. The show is on in Cape Town until 17 August before heading off to Johannesburg, then Durban.
