Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A group of mothers who've lost children and other loved ones to gang violence says deploying the army on the Cape Flats isn't working. They want government to rethink the strategy of sending in the SANDF to assist police. READ: Murders in Cape Town on the rise More than 40 people were killed and several were injured on the Cape Flats this past weekend. They gathered at the Castle Of Good Hope to share their stories of pain and sorrow. Avril Andrews formed Moms Move Justice, an organisation to help other mothers heal, after her own son was murdered. WATCH: Cape residents think the army deployed to wrong place “And then I journeyed with the moms and I invite moms because I experienced what it is to lose a child and you need to pick up the pieces. An in that time there were also mothers who wanted to take revenge. But creating that space for them, they could talk and we saw how powerful that was,” said Andrews. Leslie Wyngaard’s son was killed five years ago. She says deploying the army isn't helping. “I was hopeful. One of the opportunistic ones. You know we will take any help we can get on the Cape Flats.”
