Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - SARS hopes to collect over R30-billion after concluding investigations into alleged tax fraud. That's from just 17 cases, and there's another 1200 on the way. The revenue service is working with the NPA to bring fraudsters to the book. READ: SARS hold hands with NPA to clean house SARS Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter says the revenue service is dealing with 15 cases where the compromise is between R3-billion and R5-billion.
“There are tens of billions that's not collected because of deliberate crime activity by syndicates. There are companies and industries created purely for the purpose of creating that fraud. Mineral industries, gold for example, there's huge areas of abuse,” Kieswetter said. Kieswetter also said the death of Bosasa CEO, Gavin Watson, does not stop it from probing and acquiring any lost money. The late Bosasa boss died at a time that he faced allegations of corruption and fraud.
