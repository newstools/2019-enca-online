Several organizations have come out against the controversial traffic demerit system. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Justice Project South Africa says the traffic demerit system needs to be amended. The Administrative Adjudication of Traffic Offences Bill was signed into law this week. It could see frequent offenders lose their licenses. EXPLAINER: How the new traffic demerit system will affect drivers "It's not the points demerit system that's the problem... what's problematic is that it’s an administrative system where an accused person does not go on trial," said Howard Dembovsky, from Justice Project South Africa. The system will see motorists starting the year on 12 points each year and deductions will be made according to their behaviour. In July, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said the implementation of AARTO, was one of the ways government aimed to deal with lawlessness on our roads.
