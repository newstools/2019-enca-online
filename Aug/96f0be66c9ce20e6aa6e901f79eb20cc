Johannes Dikhoba was one of the workers moved from Kempton Park Hospital to Tembisa Hospital in 1996. Dikhoba longs for the days when the facility's CEO had meaningful engagements with staff. “He used to call us every three months to ask whether how do you feel about this job.” READ: Hospital responds after unpaid workers demand answers However, the glory days are long gone and the hospital has become a haunt for ghostbusters. In 2014, engineers were tasked to investigate the structural integrity of the now dilapidated building. According to Gauteng Infrastructure MEC Tasneem Motara, it was found to be sound at the time but it's far from ready to reopen. “Good is relative but like the conditional report stated, it is structurally sound. "Even if we were to reopen it and do minor refurbishes, the building is not going to collapse,” Motara said. It's been 23 years since Kempton Park Hospital closed down and it seems finding money to fix it up, is a major problem. Reopening the hospital could help provide better care to the 170, 000 people currently served by the over-stretched Tembisa Hospital.
