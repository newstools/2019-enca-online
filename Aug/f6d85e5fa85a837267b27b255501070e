JOHANNESBURG - Aphiwe Dyantyi looked likely to miss out on the Rugby World Cup squad due to injury but it seems he may have more to be concerned about.
The injured springbok flyer has confirmed he failed a drug test. READ: Olympic medalist Kirwa suspended for doping Dyantyi's sample taken on the second of July came back positive for a banned substance. He has denied any deliberate doping and will request a B sample to be tested. Dyantyi's fitness had already made him unlikely to be picked for the final Bok World Cup squad. READ: Doping grows in school rugby SA Rugby has declined to comment on the matter pending Dyantyi's B Sample results. The organisations also insist his recent absence from the squad has been injury-related and had nothing to do with the doping matter.
