'Hakuna Matata' - Disney accused of colonialism for trademark The owner of ESPN and theme parks had announced earlier this month that it would offer a bundle of its three streaming services, Disney+, sports service ESPN+, and Hulu, at a discounted price of $13 per month. That price is the same as Netflix Inc's most popular plan, which allows streaming on two devices simultaneously. Video streaming competition is set to intensify, with Apple Inc, WarnerMedia's HBO Max and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal planning to roll out new services. US customers are increasingly cutting the cord on cable TV, but now must decide how much they want to pay for digital offerings. Disney+ will be available on most major mobile and connected TV devices platforms, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Roku and Sony, the company said. Following the launch, the company expects to take the ad-free streaming service to major global markets within two years.
