Elise Mertens of Belgium shakes hands with Serena Williams of the United States following a second round match on Day 5 of the Rogers Cup at Aviva Centre on August 07, 2019 in Toronto, Canada. TORONTO - Serena Williams looked solid in her first match since losing the Wimbledon final, defeating 20th-ranked Elise Mertens of Belgium 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday at the WTA Toronto tournament. The 37-year-old American, one crown shy of a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, advanced in 75 minutes at her first US Open hardcourt tuneup event. "I feel like my movement is great -- been working on my fitness, so I felt like it really was able to shine through today," Williams said. "I'm loving going out there and I'm loving kind of running. So it's a good thing." READ: Serena again tops Forbes list of highest-paid sports women Also moving into the third round was Japan's Naomi Osaka, the reigning US and Australian Open champion. She won after taking the first set 6-2 when Germany's Tatjana Maria retired with a left abdominal injury. With Osaka's triumph, Australian Ashleigh Barty was ensured of being dethroned next week as world number one, although it could be Czech Kristyna Pliskova instead of Osaka who swipes the top spot. Williams, ranked 10th, seeks her fourth WTA Canada crown after 2001, 2011 and 2013 and improved her match record at the event to 31-4, winning half the 10 break points she earned against Mertens. "Now that I'm just injury-free, I'm just enjoying being able to train, and I haven't been able to do it since January, really," Williams said. "So I just think that the fact that I can train and practice and get in the gym is really going to be helpful for me."
