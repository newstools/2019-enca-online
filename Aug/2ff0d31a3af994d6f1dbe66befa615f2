File: Sebastian Vettel, winner of 52 races, has gone more than a year since he tasted victory at last year's Belgian race. SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium - Sebastian Vettel returns to the scene of his last Formula One win at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix and the German four-time champion will hope the Spa-Francorchamps circuit can hand him the break he needs to end a victory drought. Vettel, winner of 52 races, has gone more than a year since he tasted victory at last year's Belgian race. While the 32-year-old has looked a pale shadow of the driver that won four titles in a row between 2010-13, his Ferrari team have also failed to produce a car that can match the might of dominant rivals Mercedes this season. The track that hosts Sunday's race and Monza, where Ferrari's home Italian Grand Prix will be held the week after, have been singled out as the two best opportunities for the team to shine. READ: Vettel fully deserved Montreal penalty, says Rosberg "I think it's more power-sensitive ... but there is nothing that is given," said Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto, whose team have not won since last October's USÂ Grand Prix, after the race in Hungary. "I think the situation will be different to Budapest and we will try to prepare ourselves the best to seek the first victory." A fourth win would see him draw level with former team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, the most successful of the current crop of drivers at Spa. But he will first have to overcome Lewis Hamilton. The Mercedes driver, who is also a three-time winner in Belgium, has won eight of 12 races this season and leads the overall standings by 62 points from team-mate Valtteri Bottas.
