Despite his success, Arnold Vosloo says if he could do it all over again, he wouldn't leave South Africa. CAPE TOWN - South African-born Hollywood actor Arnold Vosloo returns to South African screens in his first Afrikaans film in 30 years. Vosloo opened up about his longing to come home. His new film, Griekwastad, premiered at kykNET's Silwerskermfees on Thursday. Although he had to brush up on his Afrikaans for his new movie, Vosloo regularly speaks Saffa. In Griekwastad, Vosloo plays the lead role of a policeman who investigates Don Steenkamp. The film is based on the true story of the teenager who murdered his family and raped his sister in the small Northern Cape town in 2012. Despite his success, Vosloo says if he could do it all over again, he wouldn't leave South Africa. "You lose a lot by leaving. You don't know it at the time, but you sacrifice a lot," he said. "Go if you want to go, but it's not easy over there. You have to have perseverance. "But I would say stay. Rather stay here."
