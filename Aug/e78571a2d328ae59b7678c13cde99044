It has been more than two decades since British chemical giant, Thor chemicals left behind the deadly chemical. The last deadline to clear the toxic waste was in 2013, but there’s been no progress.

Some former employees are sick and others have died due to exposure to the chemical. “It has affected our fathers, brothers and uncles in the area,” said ward councillor Musa Mkhize “We are not sure if they were compensated properly the way it’s supposed to be. So, we asked the minister to investigate further to establish a commission to make sure that we look after this problem that happened and that area is more secured.” It’s estimated that it will cost more than R300-million to treat the waste before it can be safely disposed. Government says Thor must foot the bill for the mess it left behind.
