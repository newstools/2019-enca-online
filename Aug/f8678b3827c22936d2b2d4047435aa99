People have labelled the incident as inappropriate and said it perpetuates 'rape culture.' Meanwhile, several other social media users say the men in the video are not wrong because Zodwa does not stop them from touching her. Responding following the outrage, Zodwa told TshisaLIVE that she does not have a problem with being touched by the men in the video because they are her supporters. "Those men are the ones who support me, not all these people making noise. I am theirs", said Zodwa.
