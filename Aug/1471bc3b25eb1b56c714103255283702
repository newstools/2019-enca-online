It's one of the worst environmental crises to hit the famous uMsunduzi River. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Fish are dying in the badly-polluted uMsunduzi River in KwaXimba. A spillage of vegetable oil and caustic acid from a Willowton Oil factory in Pietermaritzburg has created an environmental and health disaster in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. The locals say they fear for their lives and their livestock. “A person who did this, it shows that he or she doesn’t respect the environment and undermines people,” said Mhlakubuswa Gwala, a resident in the area. uMsunduzi is famous for the Duzi Canoe Marathon and all activities have been suspended.

I’m told some cows also have died and the smell, you can feel it yourself in the area where people live,” said local councilor Musa Mkhize. “Now, one of the things that must be investigated is why the company was built next to the river.” Provincial authorities say they are concerned about the spillage and its environmental and health risks. “It is unfortunate because we are just coming from the climate change summit where we have been dealing with the protection of our environment, the protection of our diversity,” said KZN Environmental Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube. In a statement, the Willowton Group says it’s investigating the incident.
