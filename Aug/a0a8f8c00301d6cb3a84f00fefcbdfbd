The South African Human Rights Commission had requested that Naren Sewnarain recuse himself from the matter, due to his close ties to Catzavelos’ legal representative. READ: Adam Catzavelos k-word case back in court "We learned this morning that the Magistrate used to work for Mr Catzavelos' lawyer some ten years ago and we felt that this would be prejudicial to our case and therefore requested him to recuse himself." "Our concern was that impartiality is fundamental to ensuring that there is fairness and that there is a fair trial", said Gauteng Human Rights Commission's Manager, Buang Jones. Catzavelos filmed himself using the K-word while on holiday in Greece last year, the video went viral.
