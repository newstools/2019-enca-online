The civil society organisation accuses the public protector of being unfit to hold office. UPDATE: Public Protector ordered to pay up "The parliamentary process is going to take time... So in the mean time not only are we seeking the striking off her as an advocate, which would disqualify her from her office but also a criminal investigation. "We are also asking that her deputy investigate her maladministration of the office. She is not running her office properly", said Accountability Now's Paul Hoffman. Last week Accountability Now opened a case of perjury against Mkhwebane.
