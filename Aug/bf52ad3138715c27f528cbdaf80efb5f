Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Zandile Gumede's sudden withdrawal of her resignation as eThekwini Mayor has thrown the ANC into a spin. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe admitted that the party has never faced this kind of defiance before. “It is actually an unprecedented thing as we have never had something like this before. READ: eThekwini divided over Gumede's axing "We’ve had state presidents being recalled, so the recalling and redeployment of the African National Congress members is a known norm, in fact, it is an acceptable norm.” The withdrawal of her resignation will see a delay in the swearing-in of her proposed successor, Mxolisi Kaunda. Fawzia Peer is currently serving as acting mayor of the eThekwini Municipality.
