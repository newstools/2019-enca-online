The 12-team competition gets underway this weekend. Safa hope the league will improve the standard of women’s football in the country. The association answered questions about the league while addressing the media on the sidelines of their Women in Sport Conversation. READ: Banyana Banyana's quest for recognition Fixtures for the first National Women’s League have finally been confirmed, and will run from this month to March next year. The league will not relegate any of its pioneering sides. Instead, the plan is to promote two Sasol League teams per year over the next two seasons. This will culminate in a 16-team competition in 2021. But, with the SABC hit by problems in its sports broadcasting, it is unclear if the league will be broadcast. “I know that the president has met with SuperSport, those engagements are in place, but remember, we’re also bound by the rule which says that all national events should be on SABC, so it sort of binds you a bit, but I think the president has taken a decision that let’s talk to SuperSport,” said Ria Ledwaba, Safa Vice President. A matter that is as important, is whether this national league will lead to the professionalising of women’s football. "We are responsible for the amateur league, so the organisation that is responsible for the professional league is our special member, which is the PSL, and that decision must be made by the PSL, at the time when they are ready to be able,” said Lewdwaba. This weekend’s fixtures will be played at the Nike Football Centre in Soweto.
