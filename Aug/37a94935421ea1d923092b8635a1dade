Earlier this year, Natasen detailed how Van Wyk had wanted to hide millions of rand in the Neo Solutions bank account. Natasen recorded a telephone conversation between himself and Van Wyk. His legal representative argues it strongly supports his version. Natasen has applied to cross-examine Babadi Tlatsana.

In November 2015, R9.9-million from her company, Koreneka, flowed to his company, Neo Solutions. R9.6-million was then transferred to Batsamai Investments, a company owned by Van Wyk’s partner. In doing so, SA Express’ funds went full circle. The inquiry continues on Friday.
