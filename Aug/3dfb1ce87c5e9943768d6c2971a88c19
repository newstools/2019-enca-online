"We have a really big problem with illegal dumping in the City. We know important areas, to us, for instance near the FNB stadium, it has become a really big problem, with rubble being dumped.

Minnaar adds that it is difficult to police illegal dumping because it usually happens in remote areas. "We now have a 24-hour hotline available, where people can report illegal dumping. We also have a Whatsapp number, so if you do see an offender and can take a picture of the offender, especially the number plate, so that we have it on record."
