The organisation fears the two teachers may have been victims of an organ harvesting syndicate. Twenty-two-year-old John Bothma went missing in May, while 28-year-old Mushfiq Daniels disappeared in July. Gift of the Givers' Imtiaz Sooliman says they are concerned after being contacted by the families of the two men. READ: Gift of the Givers withdraws from Makhanda "When I searched in Vietnam I found that in February, this year, the Vietnamese government smashed a massive organ smuggling syndicate. "Then we went further as to why this would be happening there? We found that there are 95 million people in Vietnam, of which 5 million people are need of an organ. There is a huge shortage", said Sooliman. Sooliman says he will appeal to the government and local law enforcement authorities to help in trying to find the men. "I am presenting this case to the South African government, to the South African Police Services, to DIRCO and I expect them to get involved as government-to-government and to bring Interpol into the matter."
