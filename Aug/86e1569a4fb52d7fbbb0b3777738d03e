File: Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. JOHANNESBURG - AfriForum has laid criminal charges against former sports minister Fikile Mbalula. The money laundering and corruption charges stem from findings by the public protector. READ: Mbalula has grand plan for transport Investigations revealed that a sporting goods supplier paid about R680,000 towards Mbalula's 2016 Dubai holiday. The report was sent to the National Prosecuting Authority for investigation but Mbalula hasn't been charged. AfriForum believes Mbalula needs to be held accountable. “The NPA’s failure to prosecute Mbalula on the PP’s recommendation compelled AfriForum to lay these charges. The Minister, by all indications, went on a vacation paid for by ‘dirty money’ and he unfairly benefited from his relationship with Sedgars; he must therefore be held accountable,” said Monique Taute, Head of AfriForum’s anti-corruption unit.
