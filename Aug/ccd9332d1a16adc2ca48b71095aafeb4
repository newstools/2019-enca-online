El Paso police are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime. EL PASO - Texas authorities are investigating Saturday's mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso as a possible hate crime, the city's police chief said, as authorities study an online manifesto linked to the suspect. A 21-year-old from Allen, a suburb of Dallas, surrendered to police outside the store after the rampage that left 20 people dead and 26 wounded. US media identified him as Patrick Crusius, who is white, and linked him to a "manifesto" posted online that includes passages railing against the "Hispanic invasion" of Texas.

Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso in Congress, said "the manifesto narrative is fueled by hate." "And it's fueled by racism and bigotry and division," she added, speaking at a press conference with El Paso Mayor Dee Margo and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. "El Paso has historically been a very safe community. We have been safe for decades. We will continue to be safe."

And there are six Mexicans among the wounded, the country's foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said.
