City being trashed, people not being able to go to work, robots not working while you don’t have metro police who can restore order, you see a city in chaos and I couldn’t allow that hence you have to negotiate,” said Stevens Mokgalapa, Tshwane Mayor. As mop-up operations continue the mayor is shrugging off criticism, even from his own party the DA, more specifically the party's federal Chairperson, James Selfe. “There’s no perfect agreement it’s always a compromise but if it brings sanity and restoration if all and order it’s something to consider,” Mokgalapa said.
