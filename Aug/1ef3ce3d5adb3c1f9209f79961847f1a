 Johannesburg, Tuesday, 27 August 2019 -  It is with devastation, shock, and deep sorrow that eNCA announces that the channel’s Director of News Ben Said drowned while on holiday with his family in Mozambique on Monday afternoon. Ben had recently returned to South Africa from TRT World in Turkey and had re-joined the senior management team at eNCA. Says eNCA’s Editor Jeremy Maggs: “Ben was one of the country’s best television journalists and his loss to the station is immense. Having just re-joined the station he was already making his presence felt across all aspects of the business. We are all in deep shock.” eMedia investments extends its sincerest condolences to his wife Nicky and his daughters Lily and Bella.
