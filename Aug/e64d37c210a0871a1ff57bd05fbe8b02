The SACP wants the NPA to investigate those implicated in state capture based on the evidence brought before the Zondo Commission. JOHANNESBURG - The state capture inquiry has heard several times about a lack of response from law enforcement agencies. The commission heard on Thursday that witness Babadi Tlatsana had to flee the country because of threats. She has implicated a SA Express executive in dodgy dealings. READ: State capture witness flees South Africa Inquiry chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was told that police had done nothing after Tlatsana laid a charge of intimidation. This hasn't gone down well with the South African Communist Party (SACP). It wants the NPA to follow up on evidence provided to the inquiry. SACP Gauteng secretary Jacob Mambolo said they staged a picket outside the NPA's office because they are concerned that not one person has yet been brought to book. READ: A year on, Zondo reflects on state capture inquiry "We are seeing very good progress and work done by the judicial commission on state capture. "At least on record to date there's not one person that has been held or brought to book and we haven't seen comments made about criminal proceedings to hold people liable," said Mambolo. "As long as there's no progress by law enforcement agencies, it will raise concerns." READ: NPA 'has enough evidence' to continue with Bosasa prosecution Meanwhile, NPA said on Wednesday the investigation into Bosasa will not be derailed by Gavin Watson's death. They said their evidence is sufficient to continue. Watson died in a car crash near the OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. He was meant to submit statements at the state capture inquiry.
