SARS says it's seeing rising levels of tax avoidance and fraud due to falling trust in the institution, by individuals and companies. SARS Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter says the auditing profession has a lot to answer for, in state capture and corruption in the country. More than 1,000 tax-related cases are awaiting prosecution. WATCH: Who is Sars' next target? The state capture project has crippled the agency, causing revenue collection and tax morale to drop. "There are still those who are in denial about the state capture project and of the fact that SARS was captured. We've experienced a hollowing out of our capacity. We've had many of the professional firms become complicit. First of all we start calling it for what it is. It's unbridled corruption," said Kieswetter. Recently SARS placed five key executives on precautionary suspension as part of a review of the institution's leadership. This follows the final report of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into tax administration and governance. Kieswetter says the auditing profession also needs to account for its role in state capture and corruption.
SARS says it'll work closely with all stakeholders to root out corruption in the public and private sectors.
