If one keeps an eye on YouTube’s trending tab, you'll be well aware of the Ubunifu Space. With over 16 million views, it features songs that fans request and many of the songs are created right here in Mzansi. Bryan, Monique, David, Sade, Ian, and Tonye come together once a week, creating reaction videos to songs from around Africa and South African tunes are getting rave reviews. WATCH: Babes Wodumo responds to backlash Born and bred in the UK, they aren’t shy to boast about their African roots. Between them, they have connections to Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Cameroon. Even though they don’t understand the meaning of many of the songs they review, they say its testament to the fact that music is a universal language. The vloggers have announced plans for an African tour at the end of the year. eNCA reporter Slindelo Masikane spoke to the crew in the video above.
