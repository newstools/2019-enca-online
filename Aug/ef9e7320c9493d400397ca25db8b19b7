Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The Public Protector took another hit in court on Thursday. The court ruled in President Cyril Ramaphosa's favour by suspending Busisiwe Mkhwebane's instruction that he must discipline Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The North Gauteng High Court also ordered Mkhwebane and the EFF to pay Ramaphosa's legal costs. READ: Court rules in favour of Ramaphosa in dispute with Public Protector The Presidency said the ruling justifies Ramaphosa's actions.
Still reeling from a series of court losses, the Public Protector's office said it would decide on the next move after studying the judgment. READ: Mkhwebane: Ramaphosa must take action against Gordhan The Public Protector's head of legal services, Alfred Mhlongo said the relief that was being sought by the presiden, is not provided for in our law. "That's one of our considerations, but mainly, we felt the president had abrogated his constitutional obligations. "He's got indispensable constitutional obligation to protect and promote the independence and integrity of the office of the Public Protector by implementing its remedial action." READ: EFF to appeal Ramaphosa vs Mkhwebane ruling The EFF couldn't hide their unhappiness either. The red berets have vowed to appeal the judgment at the Constitutional Court arguing that the Apex court has already laid down a principle for such a matter. It remains to be seen whether the Public Protector will join the EFF in its Constitutional Court challenge.
