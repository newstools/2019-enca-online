The Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha train services have not been operating for over 20 days. Amanda Nto, (19), a first-year student says she's been missing classes. "I now spend R10.00 to catch a taxi from where I stay to travel to the taxi rank. Then from there I have to spend R18.00 to go to school. So this has highly affected my budget because I had not planned for this. I have also missed classes due to not being able to afford taxi fare," said Nto.
