Queen Elsa and Princess Anna return this month in "Frozen II" -- a sequel its creators promise will be "even bigger and more epic". LOS ANGELES - Six years ago, "Frozen" shattered box office records, melted the hearts of youngsters and spawned a franchise so popular Disney was never likely to let it go. And so Queen Elsa and Princess Anna return this month in "Frozen II" -- a sequel its creators promise will be "even bigger and more epic," with its world premiere taking place in Los Angeles on Thursday night. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen," the original followed Anna on her journey to find sister Elsa, whose hard-to-control icy powers had trapped their kingdom in eternal winter. The sequel, out 22 November, explores the royal family's backstory and promises to answer fans' questions, including the source of Elsa's formidable magic. After a prologue set in the past, "Frozen II" sees a mysterious voice return to haunt grown-up Elsa. It urges her to leave her happy castle and embark upon a new, perilous quest to a far-away enchanted forest. The first "Frozen" (2013) reigned as the top-grossing animated film of all time, taking nearly $1.3-billion worldwide, until this year's "Lion King" remake came along to steal its crown. "Frozen" has since spawned a Broadway musical, theme park rides and merchandise from toy figures to books and video games. The sequel sees stars Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel -- who sang Oscar-winning showstopper "Let It Go" -- return, as do the original songwriters. Joining the starry voice cast areÂ Sterling K Brown ("This Is Us") as a soldier trapped in the forest, and Evan Rachel Wood ("Westworld") as the princesses' mother, shown in flashbacks. The excitement surrounding the sequel "will catapult it to a potentially $100m-plus opening weekend" in North American theatres.
