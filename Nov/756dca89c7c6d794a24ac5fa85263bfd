It will also be increasing the number of classrooms in high-pressure zones. This comes as up to 14,000 pupils still have to be placed for next year, ahead of the 30 November deadline.

It will also partner with some independent schools to accommodate an excess of pupils at public institutions. "There are schools who have low numbers in the townships.

For instance the unity school in Deveyton, everyone wants to go there. All the schools that are being opened now in the townships, there is no one that doesn't want to go there. We have invested a lot in making sure that our learners are taught well."
