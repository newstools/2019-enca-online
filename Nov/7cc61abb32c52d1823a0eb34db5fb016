JOHANNESBURG - The National Assembly was set to pass a bill obliging political parties to keep records of their funders and for those records to be publicly accessible. President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed the Political Party Funding Bill into law. Last year, the Constitutional Court confirmed the finding of the Western Cape High Court in a case brought by My Vote Counts, that the Promotion of Access to Information Act was unconstitutional in that it doesn’t provide for political parties to record their private funding and make it accessible to the public. Parliament was given 18 months to amend the law.
