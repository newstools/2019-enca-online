It has become a norm for these kinds of cases to take a long time. Secondly, the prosecuting team, on behalf of the family, we want to say with this kind of judgment, this is excellence on the part of the criminal justice system. Botha will serve one life sentence for murder, one each for two counts of sexual assault and five-years for defeating the ends of justice. The sentences handed down by Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe will run concurrently and Botha will only be eligible for parole after 25-years. He had pleaded guilty to all charges relating to the 19-year-old University of Cape Town's student's murder. The brutal incident occurred at a post office where Botha was employed.
