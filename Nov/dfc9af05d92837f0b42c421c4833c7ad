JOHANNESBURG - EFF spokesperson Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi stood by sentiments expressed over the Rugby World Cup victory that some South Africans found controversial. Ndlozi tweeted on the day of the final, "aggg please, today is England vs. England. I mean during 2010 World Cup the settlers had both flags in their homes & cars. It’s a win-win for them because they are still England at heart! You should be focused on removing apartheid statues".

"There is no Stronger Together, that entire sentiment is misleading," Ndlozi expounded.
