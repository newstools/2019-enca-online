SAA on Friday also signed a wage deal with the National Transport Movement. JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) reached a deal on wages with two trade unions on Friday to end an eight-day strike that has weighed on the cash-strapped state airline. SAA had to suspend hundreds of flights after the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) walked out on 15 November. The airline said it might not make salary payments this month.

Consultations on planned job cuts have been deferred until 31 January, it said. "SAA will operate a near-normal service on Saturday 23 November 2019," SAA said in a statement. "On Sunday, 24 November 2019, SAA expects to operate its full schedule as usual."

"As unions, we fought very hard to negotiate a settlement which would be in the best interests of our members and we can honestly say this proposal is a reflection of that," she said. SAA on Friday also signed a wage deal with the National Transport Movement, a union which did not participate in the strike. The government has spent about R20-billion on support for SAA in the past three years.
