Manyi has been butting heads with State Capture Inquiry evidence leader, Kate Hofmeyr. Hofmeyr questioned his appointment as Government Communications and Information Systems (GCIS) CEO at a time when he was facing dismissal from the Department of Labour. WATCH: Mzwanele Manyi questions fairness of state capture inquiry Manyi angrily denied he could have been dismissed. "It can never be factually correct to say a minister dismissed you. It doesn't exist... it's almost like saying oil has mixed with water. It doesn't happen. It's impossible. So Adv Hofmeyr must disabuse herself of this notion that a minister can dismiss. There's no such a thing," Manyi said. READ: Manyi casts doubt on state capture witnesses Manyi replaced Themba Maseko as Government Communications Information Systems CEO.
