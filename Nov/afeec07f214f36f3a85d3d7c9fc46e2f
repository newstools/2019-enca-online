England's head coach Eddie Jones holds a ball before the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup final match between England and South Africa. TOKYO - England are set to begin talks with coach Eddie Jones about the prospect of the Australian leading them at the 2023 World Cup in France when the beaten finalists return home from Japan. Jones, appointed after England's woeful first-round exit on home soil at the 2015 edition, almost achieved his four-year plan of turning them into world champions only for South Africa to overwhelm the Red Rose brigade 32-12 in Saturday's final in Yokohama. But the way a largely youthful side -- with 25 members of a squad of 32 in their twenties -- beat Australia and defending champions New Zealand in knockout play won plaudits. Jones's current contract runs until 2021 and Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of England's Rugby Football Union, has no doubt the 59-year-old coach will see out that deal. "Eddie's one of the world's best coaches -- if not the best -- despite the result against South Africa," Sweeney said.

"Eddie is committed to his contract through to the end of August 2021 and he is fulfilling that." But Sweeney accepts the logic that if the RFU and Jones are both happy for him to go halfway through a World Cup cycle, he should see it through to the next edition. "It makes sense doesn't it?" he said. "If you're going to go through to France 2023 it's nice to have that unbroken stretch, but both parties have got to be completely happy with it."
