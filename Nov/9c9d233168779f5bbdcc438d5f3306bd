SAA is working on making sure all flights are back to normal after an 8-day long strike. The troubled airline has also told employees that upcoming salaries will be delayed. eNCA's Heidi Giokos has more. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways says it is working on raising enough funds to pay employees at the end of the month. Spokesperson Tlali Tlali says the airline is working with lenders, but a date for payments has not yet been set. "The payment of employee salaries will be delayed. In other words, they will not get their salaries (on the 25th and 27th). The main reason has to do with an exercise that is underway where we are seeking to raise working capital in the amount of R2-billion." SAA reached a deal on wages with two trade unions on Friday to end an eight-day strike that has weighed on the cash-strapped state airline. The national carrier had to suspend hundreds of flights after the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) walked out on 15 November. READ: SAA, unions reach agreement SAA on Friday said the unions had agreed to a 5.9 percent wage hike retroactive to April, to be paid from next February if sufficient funds were available. Consultations on planned job cuts have been deferred until 31 January, it said. SAA also signed a wage deal with the National Transport Movement, a union which did not participate in the strike. The government has spent about R20-billion on support for SAA in the past three years. Watch the full interview with SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali above.
