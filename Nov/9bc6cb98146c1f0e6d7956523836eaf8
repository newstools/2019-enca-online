CAPE TOWN - After two long months, the Mvinjelwa family has finally won the rights to bury Pumla Mvinjelwa and her two children who were murdered by her husband who then turned the gun on himself. The Ntombela and the Mvinjelwa families have been at odds over who has the right to bury 10-year-old Nhanhla and 6-year-old Bajabulile Ntombela. The court has ruled that when Sitembile Ntombela killed his wife and children, these rights were forfeited.
