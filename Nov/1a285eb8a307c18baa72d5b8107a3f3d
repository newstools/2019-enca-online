Vets say quite often baby pangolins are born immature and most only live for 3 days. They say the poaching of these defenceless animals is a crisis. Activists around Africa have come together to try and fight the scourge. Over the past three years Karin Lourens, a vet, has saved 60 pangolins, but this doesn't even put a dent in the damage caused by the black market. "Last year alone they found 62 tons of scales, alone, just scales not the animal. That’s about 300, 000 animals and that’s the only ones they intercepted. So you can imagine how many we don’t know about. And if you put lion, elephant tasks whatever you put together won’t even come to a tenth of their poaching rate at the moment," Lourens said.
