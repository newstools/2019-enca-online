Their leaders have promised a mass walkout and they're vowing never to return to South Africa.

"It was a disgrace what happened on Friday. "I understand people were angry. But to attack people and beat people I’m sorry. It should never have happened.” Storey has appealed to South Africans not to let the incident overshadow the plight of refugees.

Storey is also calling on Home Affairs officials to play their part and issue the refugees and asylum seekers with necessary documents as soon as possible. He says his only concern is about their safety especially the women and children. Storey has also highlighted the health risks given the limited toilet and ablution facilities at the church.
