AUCKLAND - New Zealand Rugby are compiling their shortlist of head coach candidates to take over from Steve Hansen and will announce his successor in December, chairman Brent Impey said on Tuesday.

"We congratulate and wish Jamie well as he continues his work coaching the Brave Blossoms," Impey said in a statement. "We respect his decision and his abilities as a coach. "The All Blacks head coach selection panel will continue their shortlisting process, with interviews and negotiations to be conducted through November and early December. "We are looking forward to announcing the next head coach of the All Blacks next month." Current All Blacks assistant Ian Foster and Crusaders coach Scott Robertson are among the favourites to take over.
