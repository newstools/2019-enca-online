File: Traditionally the day is marked with various celebrations across the country. JOHANNESBURG - The NSPCA is urging people to be considerate and to adhere to by-laws related to fireworks ahead of Guy Fawks Day celebrations on Tuesday. Traditionally the day is marked with various celebrations across the country, including setting off fireworks, which can cause distress for many animals. The organisation said cats and dogs are afraid of fireworks due to their ability to hear a wider range of sounds. "Dogs can hear five times more acutely than humans; and cats about twice as acutely as dogs," the SPCA said. Listed below are guidelines from the organisation to help pet owners during this time: Setting off fireworks is not illegal in South Africa, however certain areas have by-laws which prohibit people from using fireworks without permission from relevant authorities or during certain times.
