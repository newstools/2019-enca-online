JOHANNESBURG - Stage 2 load-shedding ended at 5am on Friday morning, but Eskom warned it may be back soon. The power utility implemented load-shedding from 10pm Thursday night after losing three more generation units and using its emergency reserves. Eskom's COO Jan Oberholzer said the system is constrained and critically low emergency reserves had to be replenished overnight.

LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you Eskom distributed a factsheet on what preparations can be made by people to mitigate the effects of power cuts. Among other suggestions, Eskom recommends keeping your cellphone charged when the power is on and using car chargers and power packs if the power is low. The utility said people should make meals before the power cuts and keeping battery- or gas-powered lighting close in the event of a cut.
