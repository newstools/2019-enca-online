VENICE - Venice was braced for an unprecedented third major flooding in less than a week, with seawater due to swamp the already devastated historic city where authorities have declared a state of emergency. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro ordered the iconic St Mark's Square closed on Friday as the latest sea surge struck with strong storms and winds battering the region. After a brief respite on Saturday, the city forecast high water of 160 centimetres for just after midday on Sunday, lower than Tuesday's high of 187 centimetres but still dangerous. Churches, shops and homes in the city, a UNESCO World Heritage site, have been inundated by unusually intense "acqua alta", or high water, which on Tuesday hit its highest level in half a century. "We've destroyed Venice, we're talking about one billion (euros) in damage," Brugnaro said after the second major flooding of around 160 centimetres hit on Friday. The crisis has prompted the government to release 20 million euros in funds to tackle the devastation. Surveying the damage, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini warned the task of repairing the city would be huge. More than 50 churches had suffered damage, he said. Many, including Venice's mayor, have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that the country prone to natural disasters must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons. The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to 50,000 residents but receives 36 million visitors each year.
