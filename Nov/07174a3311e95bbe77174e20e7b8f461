The battle for political control of the DA-run Johannesburg and Tshwane metros is on. In Johannesburg, the mayoral election was postponed until next week. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Lebogang Maile, wants answers as to why the vote for a Johannesburg mayor was postponed. Maile argues council speaker, Vasco da Gama, does not have the authority to make such decisions. WATCH: Gauteng DA-led metros face two no confidence votes "Unfortunately, it seems the speaker might have breached certain provisions of the code of conduct for councillors. I will be writing to him as a custodian of that code of conduct." "You can't decide to postpone council when it's in session without the majority of councillors taking that decision. The speaker decided on his own that the session must be adjourned. He can't do that. He is not above the council. Council is the highest decision-making body."
