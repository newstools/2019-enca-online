German F1 driver Sebastian Vettel powers his Ferrari at the Interlagos racetrack in Sao Paulo, Brazil. SAO PAULO - Sebastian Vettel topped the times despite a "scruffy" lap as Ferrari delivered a resounding one-two to prove they are back on form in second free practice for this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. The four-time champion clocked a best lap in one minute and 9.217 seconds to outpace Charles Leclerc by 0.021 seconds in a close finish to a session that, like the first, ended with a red flag and two cars off the track. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was third ahead of Valtteri Bottas in the leading Mercedes, six-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes and Kevin Magnussen for Haas. "It was not a very tidy lap," said Vettel, who felt satisfied at his efforts, before turning his attention to the way in which Ferrari had been linked to unconfirmed allegations of "cheating" in the aftermath of the United States Grand Prix. "I just said earlier that opinions swing so quickly nowadays," he explained. "In one race, in one and a half hours, it can be so different – and in one race can change again. I just think we can provide all our answers on the track." Verstappen said he also felt he had a "bit of a messy day because of the changing weather". He added: "I think the lap times are not really representative as the track and ambient temperatures are pretty different to what it looks like for tomorrow and Sunday. "It’s positive that the car was straight away working well, there are of course always things you can improve, but it was a good start and we have a good basis for tomorrow."
