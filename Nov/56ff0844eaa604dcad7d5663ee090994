The 2019 Diners Club Winemaker and Young Winemaker of the year winners will be announced at a gala dinner in Franschhoek on 23 November 2019. You can watch the event live here. Diners Club introduced the Winemaker of the Year award in 1981 to encourage local winemakers to raise the standard of wines produced in South Africa. Eighteen years later, the Young Winemaker of the Year award was established to encourage winemakers under the age of 30 develop their skills, express their individuality, and add to the future prestige of South African wines internationally. The awards focus on quality and recognition of excellence and are regarded as the country's most prestigious and well-respected wine industry competition. The competition is open to all in the South African wine industry. The Diners Club Winemaker and Young Winemaker of the Year awards celebrate not only the wine, but also the skills and talents of the vintners. The awards are presented to the winemakers who produce a wine that the judging panel considers to be the best in a specified class. The categories this year are Pinot Noir wines for Winemaker of the Year, and White Wines of any varietal or blend for Young Winemaker of the Year. As with previous years, winemakers can be shortlisted for more than one submission.
