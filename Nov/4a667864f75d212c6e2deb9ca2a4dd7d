#DStv403 DURBAN - The case involving four suspects arrested in connection with the kidnapping of Sandra Moonsamy has been remanded to 18 November. The state also brought forward an application for the case to be held in camera as there is a belief that publication on the matter might jeopardize the 'sensitive' investigation.

After an intensive Hawks investigation, she was found bound at a house in eMalahleni on Thursday. Moonsamy's abductors allegedly demanded millions in ransom. Three luxury vehicles worth R3-million and a firearm have been seized for further investigation. Authorities are liaising with Interpol to find out if the suspects - aged between 30 and 34 - are wanted outside the country.
