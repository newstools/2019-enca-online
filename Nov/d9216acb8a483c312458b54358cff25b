This as government launches the national disability awareness month. Palesa Manaleng said support and representation of the differently able are what is needed. ”Here’s a challenge, how about we make all pavements user-friendly? All of them across South Africa. Since we’re doing disability month, this month!” READ: Disabled boy realises dream of going to school Manaleng said as things stand, the future for the differently able is grim. She has called for equal treatment and appreciation. “Imagine if we were showing the world championships that are happening now in Paralympics and we were showing all the games and some kid or some parent sees a kid like theirs. "Imagine the mind shift of that parent who’s been locking their kid in the backroom afraid of what people might say,” added Manaleng.
