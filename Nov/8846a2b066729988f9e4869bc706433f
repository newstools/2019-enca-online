JOHANNESBURG - Businesswoman and mining magnate Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe’s troubles in Botswana are not over yet after being accused of money-laundering, terrorism, and attempting to influence the country's recent elections. WATCH: Bridgette Radebe sets record straight on Botswana allegations The country recently elected President Mokgweetsi Masisi who took power from former president Ian Khama after he stepped down from the presidency. The president was elected in October general polls, though the opposition called the vote rigged. Travel restrictions were imposed on Motsepe-Radebe after the election. South Africans normally do not require advanced visas to travel to Botswana. Reasons were not stated for the visa requirement, although Motsepe-Radebe has faced allegations she interfered in the recent leadership election of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in a bid to remove Masisi. South African banks have offered some vindication. Nedbank and Absa say she is not a signatory on accounts allegedly set up for illicit money flows.
