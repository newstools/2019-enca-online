JOHANNESBURG - Power FM's Chairman, Given Mkhari accepted President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to withdraw from this year's Chairman's Conversation on Thursday. The president's decision comes after pressure from civil society organisations, Wise 4 Africa and the Soul City Institute. The organisations cited assault charges laid against Mkhari by his wife. They say while the charges were eventually withdrawn, Mkhari never accounted for his actions.
