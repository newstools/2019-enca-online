JOHANNESBURG - Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum says it will sue the Gauteng Education MEC for defamation. This follows a claim by MEC Panyaza Lesufi that AfriForum had been following him and his family, and was trying to assassinate him. READ: ANC Gauteng dismisses AfriForum's call to remove Lesufi AfriForum's deputy CEO Ernst Roets denied the allegations were true and said the MEC is either lying about the claims or believes them to be true. Roets asserted either case disqualifies Lesufi from serving as the Education MEC in the province. Lesufi has shared harassment he has received on Twitter, calling one of his harassers an AfriForum member.
