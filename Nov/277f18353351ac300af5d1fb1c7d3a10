Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - He has a mountain to climb but is Andre de Ruyter up to the mammoth task of fixing Eskom? The Pretoria-born businessman has an MBA from the Netherlands and extensive experience in the energy and manufacturing sector. Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has thrown its weight behind the new Eskom CEO but unions have criticised the appointment. READ: EFF rejects de Ruyter's appointment as Eskom CEO “He’s willing to actually do the hard work and ensure that this entity that is now a sovereign risk to South Africa’s economy is turned around,” said BLSA CEO, Busisiwe Mavuso. De Ruyter spent about 20-years working as a Sasol executive and helped turn around its fortunes. Eskom bailout: Parliament says no more blank cheques He also took over packaging firm Nampak at a time when it was heavily indebted. Under his leadership, Nampak used the services of discredited consulting firm Bain to oversee its restructuring process, which led to fears of job cuts. Some believe de Ruyter has what it takes to fix Eskom's massive debt problem.
