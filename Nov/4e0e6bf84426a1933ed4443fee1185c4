Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Numsa has responded to SAA's threat of legal action over statements about the airline's safety. READ: SAA threatens legal action over union comments "As Numsa and as Sacca, we will not withdraw our statement. Every word of what we said is true. SAA is relying on inexperienced workers to do the work of safety officers in terms of the cabin crew. They are relying on temporary technicians to do the work of repairing and maintaining planes." "We are warning South African citizens who are flying SAA to change their flights because to fly SAA while we are on strike is to gamble with your life," Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, Numsa spokesperson said on Sunday. Hlubi-Majola said SAA acting-CEO Zukisa Ramasia has not addressed all the demands of the unions including in-sourcing. In-sourcing, unions claim, would force the airline carrier to root out corruption and reduce procurement costs, freeing up enough funds for salary increases as well as ensuring job security. The union spokesperson also reiterated their commitment to a secondary strike.
