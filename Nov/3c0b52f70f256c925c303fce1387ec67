CAPE TOWN - HIV/Aids is still a taboo topic for South Africa's youth but research shows that 39 percent of new infections occur between the ages of 15 and 24. A new local app by Doctors Without Borders and Aviro Health now provides the youth with a platform to speak freely about the disease. The Khetha app is designed for those yearning for help to challenge the pandemic. Almost 8 million South Africans are living with HIV, according to Stats SA and last year, nearly 240,000 new infections were recorded.

"We involve the youth very heavily in the process. So, right from the beginning when we designed what the educational content will be, we talked to a lot of youth. This is a mobile-based platform and we know that cellphone penetration smartphone penetration is very high," said e-health manager, Damon Hacking.
With World Aids Day around the corner, the app's founders say this is not a campaign to mark the occasion.
