Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has warned public officials to curb their spending as the country faces a revenue shortfall but not everyone seems to be concerned by the minister's proclamation. Courtesy of #DSTV403 DURBAN - Despite warnings from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to curb public spending, news of excessive spending by government officials is still being broken. Taxpayers are forking out R90,000 monthly to rent a car for a KwaZulu-Natal government official. Provincial Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu says he's paying that amount for a luxury Mercedes-Benz vehicle. This is despite his predecessor's car being available for him to use. Mshengu insists he was advised that the vehicle is not roadworthy.

"The HoD said to me that would be more expensive, that [it] would cost the department more than the car we can hire." The MEC said the cost of hiring the replacement car is R90,000 monthly. Mshengu said he has not personally been corresponding with the Mercedes-Benz dealership or the car hire services. He also indicated he would be writing to the Public Protector, requesting she investigate the matter.
