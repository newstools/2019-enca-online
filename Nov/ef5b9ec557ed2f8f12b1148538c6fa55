US singer-songwriter John Legend arrives for the 2019 LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles on November 2, 2019. LOS ANGELES -Â Multi-talented singer and actor John Legend was named People magazine's "sexiest man alive" on Tuesday, but said he wondered whether he could live up to the title. Legend, 40, is married to model Chrissy Teigen with whom he has two children and is the first black man to have achieved coveted Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony (EGOT) status for his work on stage and screen. "I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it's a lot of pressure," the entertainer told People magazine. "Everyone's going to be picking me apart to see if I'm sexy enough to hold this title. I'm (also) following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!"

Other actors and singers who have been given the title by the magazine's editors in recent years include Blake Shelton, Chris Hemsworth, Adam Levine, George Clooney and Channing Tatum. Legend, currently a coach on USÂ television talent series The Voice,Â won the first of 10 Grammys for his 2004 debut album Get LiftedÂ and its hit ballad Ordinary People. He took home an Oscar for the song GloryÂ for the movie Selma, a Tony for co-producing the Broadway play JitneyÂ and an Emmy for producing the 2018 television adaptation of Jesus Christ SuperstarÂ in which he played Jesus.

Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed but thank you @People for finding me sexy.  I'll take it ðŸ¤“ A post shared by  John Legend (@johnlegend) on Nov 12, 2019 at 6:27pm PST
