The nostalgic mob movie sees a former mafia hitman (Robert De Niro) reflect on his violent life, including his relationship with a disappeared union leader (Al Pacino). LOS ANGELES - Director Martin Scorsese praised the "magical" relationship between Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in the trio's new gangster epic "The Irishman". The legendary filmmaker has made headlines over the past month with his trenchant criticism of modern-day Hollywood superhero movies as "not cinema." But at an American Film Institute tribute event in Los Angeles, Scorsese preferred to discuss the long-standing collaborations of his own generation. "What we see in the film is their relationship as actors, as friends over the past 40, 45 years," he said. "There's something magical that happens there."

De Niro and Pacino co-starred -- separately -- in "The Godfather: Part II" (1974), before memorably sharing the screen in 1995's neo-noir classic "Heat." Scorsese said trust between filmmakers was essential, before quipping that they also "have to have some talent." "The Irishman" is Scorsese's ninth film as director with De Niro, whom he has known since they were both sixteen.
