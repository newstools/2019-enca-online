A post by Pastor Angus Buchan has prompted an outcry from social media and provoked a response from an EFF representative, inciting violence. JOHANNESBURG - Prominent Christian evangelist Angus Buchan has apologised on Wednesday for saying only Jewish and Afrikaans people have been in a covenant with God. In a video clip circulated by EFF MP Floyd Shivambu, Buchan is heard saying, "remembering that only two nations in the world have ever been in covenant with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They are the Jewish people and the Afrikaans people. That is a fact." The evangelist was promoting the "Stand Up For Jesus" event planned on 1 February at Loftus Stadium.

The EFF’s Godrich Gardee has posted in a now-deleted tweet that limpet mines should be placed as booby-traps at Loftus Versfeld. The evangelist later apologised via his Facebook page saying it was a misunderstanding.

"The word covenant in the Oxford Dictionary means: "An agreement held to be the basis of a relationship of commitment with God"." "Having stated that the Jews and the Afrikaans peoples were the only two Nations that had a covenant with God is totally wrong and for that statement, I humbly ask your forgiveness." "In all my years as a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, it has never, ever been my intention to hurt any man, woman, or child or create division amongst any race, people or creed in this beautiful Country of ours, South Africa. If my statement has led to any division, please forgive me."
