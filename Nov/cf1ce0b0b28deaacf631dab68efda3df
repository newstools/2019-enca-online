Match Abandoned due to wet outfield during the 2019 Mzansi Super League match betweenDurban Heat v Paarl Rocks at Kingsmead, Durban, on 15 November 2019. JOHANNESBURG - The second edition of the Mzansi Super League is well underway, however, despite efforts to shift matches to suit the fans, poor attendance continues to be a major concern to Cricket South Africa. The Mzanzi Super League has the international flavour alongside some of the modern-day cricket heroes. In the planning process, Cricket South Africa ensured fixtures would suit fans in terms of the times. The Jozi Stars hosted two games at the Wanderers with a total of 7,684 people attending two matches.

One team is getting it right though, by getting fans to the stadium at Boland Park. The Paarl Rocks team led by Faf du Plessis attracted 5,500 for their match against the Tshwane Spartans, having sold out their embankments. Poor attendance certainly will not alleviate the reported over R600-million debt Cricket South Africa currently has.
