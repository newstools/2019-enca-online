JOHANNESBURG - Ex-Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer, Anoj Singh, is in deep trouble. He's facing 18 charges issued by the chartered accountants' regulator.

Singh was conspicuous by his absence at a disciplinary on Wednesday. The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) has already provisionally suspended him pending the outcome of this inquiry.
The disciplinary hearing, scheduled for July, was delayed. WATCH: Anoj fails to sing as Eskom inquiry questions competency His appearance was doubtful by late last month. "Mr Singh was abroad and not able to attend the pre-hearing," said Saica's lawyer, advocate Ngwako Hamilton Maenetje SC. The charges relate to his conduct as CFO of Transnet, then Eskom. Saica has charged Singh with gross negligence, breaching the code of conduct, acting dishonestly and bringing SAICA into disrepute. Singh has provided a written response on the Eskom charges and pleaded not guilty on the Transnet front. Singh could face suspension from Saica for up to twelve months and a fine of R250,000.
