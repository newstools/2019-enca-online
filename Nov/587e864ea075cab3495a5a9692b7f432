ROME - Former UEFA president Michel Platini has slammed the use of VAR technology, the introduction of which he has always opposed, as a total nightmare, in an interview on Italian television. "It would take half an hour to explain why it doesn't solve problems," the former France international told the "Che tempo che fa" late-night talk show on Rai on Sunday. "It shifts them. I'm against VAR. I think it's a load of crap and unfortunately we will not go back."

A triple Ballon d'Or winner, Platini had been expected to succeed Sepp Blatter as FIFA president in 2016 but fell spectacularly from grace a few months earlier. The former France captain was suspended by world football's governing body in 2015 over a controversial payment of two million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) that he received from Blatter. Platini has always insisted he did nothing wrong. READ: Banyana Banyana captain backs VAR, but says grey areas remain "At FIFA, they did not want me as president," he continued.
