They are developing a male manifesto to hold each pupil accountable for their actions.

Deon Oersen, the headmaster in charge of wellness, said the Grade 10 and 11 pupils as well as principal Andre Oosthuizen, drafted the manifesto. READ: Has 16 Days of Activism helped? Oersen said, "we deemed it necessary to publicise the manifesto because it forms part of our hidden curriculum and by doing that, we encourage our boys to commit and speak out when they experience or are aware of any violence against women and children. St Benedict's pupil Pitse Matsheke spoke about how the manifesto changed the way he related to women. Matsheke said, "what I gain from this manifesto is that there are many promises that we should do and there are many positives that we have to go to and many negatives that we have to go against." "My personal one, that I always look to the most is: to always treat women equally."
