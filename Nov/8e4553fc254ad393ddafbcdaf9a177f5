JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's Integrity Commission wants the party's NEC to suspend Bongani Bongo from all political activities. That's until he's cleared of corruption charges levelled against him.
It also slapped Bongo on the wrist for accusing Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan of being behind his arrest.
The Integrity Commission says his actions have caused unnecessary tensions and divisions within the party.
