De Ruyter, who is currently Nampak CEO, has been tasked with turning around the embattled utility. He spent around 20 years working at Sasol and Eskom believes this will help him in his new role. Years of corruption, mismanagement and state capture have brought the utility and the national grid to the brink of collapse. It's debt skyrockets each year as it incurs continued multi-billion-rand losses. De Ruyter will replace Phakamani Hadebe from 15 January 2020.
