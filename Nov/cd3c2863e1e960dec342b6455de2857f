The province has failed to convene a provincial general council but says an elective conference will be held in December. Top contenders are the premier and the acting provincial chairperson.

A long-time ally of Mabuza and former provincial secretary, Mandla Ndlovu, is now backing ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule on national level, resulting in a rift between him and deputy president.

"The only time that I will be asked that question will be in the conference after nominations when everybody will be asked whether they accept the nomination or not."
ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has addressed the party, cautioning members against electing fraudsters who can be captured.
