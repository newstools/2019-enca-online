On Friday, KwaZulu-Natal High Court dismissed his latest application for leave to appeal, following the court's refusal to grant him a permanent stay of prosecution on corruption charges. Zuma and his co-accused, the French arms company, Thales are attempting to stop the corruption and fraud trial from going ahead. WATCH: Court dismisses Zuma's appeal Zuma believes another court will come to a different conclusion. “He’ll say to them your colleagues in the Pietermaritzburg High Court have denied me this appeal. I believe that the chances of success are greater, please look at my papers and if you so believe, as I believe, please allow me to argue in front of you,” said legal expert, Mpumelelo Zikalala. Zuma's criminal trial's set to start in February next year.
