A dehydrated and injured koala receives treatment at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital after its rescue from a bushfire that has ravaged an area of over 2,000 hectares. NEW SOUTH WALES - The Eastern Australian bushfires have taken another unexpected life. Lewis the Koala bear has died. Lewis stole hearts when a viral video showed him being saved from the fire by a local elderly woman, Toni Doherty. In the footage, she wrapped him in her shirt and cooled his burns with water. However, her gracious efforts were not enough as several days later he succumbed to the burns on his hands, feet, arms and inside of his legs.

We placed him under general anaesthesia this morning to assess his burns injuries and change the bandages. We recently posted that "burns injuries can get worse before they get better". In Ellenborough Lewis's case, the burns did get worse, and unfortunately would not have gotten better. The Koala Hospital's number one goal is animal welfare, so it was on those grounds that this decision was made. We thank you for your ongoing support,” it said in a statement. In his final days, Lewis could only eat a single leaf at a time and would struggle to finish it.
