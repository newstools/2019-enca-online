QUEENSTOWN - A Queenstown woman has gone from being unemployed to making her mark as a well-established groom in the horse-racing world. Based in the Western Cape, she takes care of two famous winners. Gloria Mpateni is one of only a dozen female horse grooms in the country. A mother of three, she says winning filly Follow the Star is just as much her baby. She nurtures and cares for it in every way, from feeding to washing and even nursing it. There are many factors that contribute to a champion racehorse, and Gloria’s role is just one of those -- vital to the filly’s success. Follow the Star just recently took first place at a racing event in Cape Town, a proud moment for Gloria.
