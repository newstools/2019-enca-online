What did Langa do to her? How could she be so cruel?" "She knows Langa is my only child. I don't have a sister, I don't have parents. Langa was my hope and she knows that. She knew everything about me. I shared everything with her. I just kept asking myself, why," Mnguni said after the court appearance. The family said they do not want bail to be granted to her.
