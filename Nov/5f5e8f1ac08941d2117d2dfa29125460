While he’s taking precautions to stay safe, he says he knows there are political plots to bring him down.

WATCH: Whistleblower wants Ramaphosa to deliver on alleged promise Zulu says he feels let down by President Cyril Ramaphosa's alleged delay in making sure he's protected. Two law enforcement agencies and the Public Protector recommended Zulu and his fellow anti-corruption activist, Les Stuta, be provided with state protection but Police Minister, Bheki Cele is taking Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s recommendations on review.
Both Zulu and Stuta are friends of the late former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa, who was killed in a hail of bullets in 2017. He was speaking during an exclusive interview with eNCA's Mmanaledi Mataboge-Mashetla. This interview took place in secret, surrounded by his heavily armed friends who are acting as his bodyguards and until Thabiso Zulu gets proper protection, this corruption whistleblower is living each day as his last.
