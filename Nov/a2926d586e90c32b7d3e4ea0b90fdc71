The City says congestion costs it R2.8-billion a year, due to a lack of productivity, as well as businesses struggling to deliver on time. Parking spaces in the inner city are now under the spotlight.

One food-delivery driver, who has asked for his identity to be concealed, says this will have a negative impact on him. E-hailing services have not only become a lucrative business for drivers but they are a very convenient way to travel. The City of Cape Town says its plans are not intended to deter drivers.

"But how do we change people's lives while respecting other people in the process? Is to be able to bring people around and engage and that's what we want to do."
Cape Town is not alone in trying to impose regulations. The US city of Chicago this week proposed an increase in taxes on rides in Ubers and those of its competitors. In response to the City of Cape Town's motion, ride-hailing service Bolt says it's willing to engage with the City in the new year.
