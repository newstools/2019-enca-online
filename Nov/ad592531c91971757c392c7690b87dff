It comes amid the general crime wave that's experienced in South Africa over the festive season. This is partly due to people spending more over Christmas than at other times of the year.

Giving it protection against bombing, protection against cutting and grinding, as a result, we built a technology that can protect the ATM,” said Secure Banking Technologies CEO, Makhosini Kharodi. Criminals have turned to high-tech explosives to blow apart ATM machines. However, new smart ATMs with special sensors and bomb-proof dye stain bottles are reducing the amount of money robbers have been able to steal. eNCA's Nqobile Madlala put the smart ATM to the test in the video above
