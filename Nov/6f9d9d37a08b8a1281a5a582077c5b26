Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Less than six months into his administration, speculation is rife that President Cyril Ramaphosa is said to be considering a Cabinet reshuffle. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says Ramaphosa is not in a position to appoint a Cabinet he would want. “The issue is that even if he goes for this reshuffling, there ought to be a compromise. I don't think he is in a position to have his Cabinet as he would like it... the same compromise that was reached, to some degree, when his Cabinet was announced will most likely come to bear on this one.” WATCH: President Ramaphosa announces his cabinet The party appears to be marred with infighting, with some members pushing for the restructuring of the National Working Committee. Mathekga says Ramaphosa must focus on both the party and government duties. “If the president neglects the party, you end up having a leadership contest loaded within the party and actually contesting what the president is doing in government. You cannot have the president who completely ignores them. It's a recipe for disaster,” said Mathekga. The governing party will go to the National General Council (NGC) in 2020. Mathekga said the NGC “will be used the wind is blowing in terms of policy.”
