File: Eddie Jones, who has committed to seeing out his contract which runs until 2021, is not renowned for owning up to errors. LONDON - England coach Eddie Jones wants his team to become the "powerhouse of world rugby" but has admitted he made a mistake in his selection for the World Cup final. The 59-year-old Australian, who has committed to seeing out his contract which runs until 2021, is not renowned for owning up to errors. But he says part of the blame for the 32-12 defeat by South Africa in the final lay with his decision to start with George Ford and Mako Vunipola ahead of Henry Slade and Joe Marler. "I had been right against Australia and New Zealand but, as it turned out, in the biggest game of our four-year cycle, I got it badly wrong," writes Jones in his soon-to-be-published autobiography 'My Life and Rugby' which is being serialised in The Times. "Hindsight is a wonderful teacher." READ: England say 'makes sense' for Jones to coach them at 2023 World Cup Jones has turned England's fortunes round after taking over following their humiliating pool-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup. A crushing victory over two-time defending champions New Zealand in the semi-finals last month has given Jones plenty of enthusiasm to continue, but he has stopped short of committing to taking the team to the 2023 World Cup. "I am definitely staying as England's coach for another two years," says Jones. "My contract runs until 2021. I'm excited by what our young team can achieve. "The potential is massive. Not only are they great rugby players but they are better people with outstanding character. "I believe I can keep making a difference with them over the next two years. We want to become the powerhouse of world rugby. "After that? We'll see. It's too early to know and, right now, I am happy to just hit the pause button."
