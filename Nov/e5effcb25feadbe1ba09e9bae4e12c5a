According to legend, the 42.195km route from Marathon to Athens was first run by Pheidippides, an Athenian messenger who in 490 BC dashed to the city to announce victory over the Persians, before dying of exhaustion. Baron de Coubertin, creator of the modern Olympics, introduced the race into the first Games in Athens in 1896 when it was won by the Greek water-carrier Spiridon Louis.
