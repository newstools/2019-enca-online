File: WADA's Compliance Review Committee recommended the ban on Monday, accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data handed over to investigators. MOSCOW - Russia's anti-doping chief said he expected the country to be barred from all sporting competition for four years after a bombshell recommendation from the World Anti-Doping Agency that shocked Russian athletes. WADA's Compliance Review Committee recommended the ban on Monday, accusing Moscow of falsifying laboratory data handed over to investigators. It recommended Russia also face a four-year ban from staging or bidding for major international sporting events -- putting Saint Petersburg's status as a host city for the Euro 2020 football tournament in doubt. The committee's recommendation is set to go before WADA's Executive Committee at a meeting in Paris on 9 December. Asked if he expected the recommendation to be upheld, RUSADA chief Yury Ganus told AFP: "That's the reality." "We are plunging, for the next four years, into a new phase of Russia's doping crisis," Ganus said, pointing out that the ban would affect Russian athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. "The most difficult and tragic thing is that our athletes have become hostages of the actions of our sports officials," he said. Russian track and field athletes were barred from competing at the Rio Olympics in 2016 although Russians competing in other events were allowed to take part. The ban was widened to include all events at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, though Russian competitors who could prove they were above suspicion were able to compete as neutrals under the Olympic flag. WADA's recommendation is part of a campaign to put Russia "on the defensive, as the accused party," complained Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, RIA Novosti news agency reported. "We are basically accused of everything everywhere, whatever sphere of international life you take."
