Rugby World Cup champions 2019! • “Tonight was not England’s night, but the whole nation is incredibly proud of what @EnglandRugby have achieved over the past few months. Hold your heads high boys, you did an outstanding job and we couldn’t have asked more from you. To the whole of South Africa - rugby unites all of us in more ways than we can imagine, and tonight I have no doubt that it will unite all of you. After last month’s visit, I can’t think of a nation that deserves it more. Well done and enjoy!
