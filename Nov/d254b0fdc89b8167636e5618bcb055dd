Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - The ANC says it has proof of DA corruption and irregular appointments at the City of Tshwane and will take it all the way to the top. It has presented alleged collusion between a former city employee and engineering company Aurecon to secure a R14-million tender. The tender relates to the review of the city's R10-billion property register. READ: City of Tshwane in another tender scandal But the company has denied the claims. The ANC accuses Zania Lambert of fast-tracking Aurecon's appointment and paying them before a service level agreement was signed. "How was the payment made, then? Who made it? On whose behalf? We must ask those questions," said ANC Tshwane region chairperson Kgosi Maepa.

The ANC says it will now take this evidence to the public protector and the NPA. Meanwhile, they also want other municipal officials implicated in the saga to be suspended.
