Veteran actor Sello Maake ka-Ncube says men have to play an active role in ending abuse of women and children. LONDON - The Commonwealth announced on Monday -- International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women -- that it was teaming up with the NO MORE Foundation, a global movement of 1,400 organisations working to stop domestic and sexual abuse. Domestic violence is a pandemic that costs billions of dollars a year, be it in lost work, damaged children or police time, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said.

Violence in the home often affects a victim's work and increases absenteeism, she said. It also costs the health services, police and criminal justice systems and may set back any children in the family, with repercussions for their future. "If we don't have peace in our homes, we are very unlikely to have peace in our world," she said.

Globally, only two-thirds of countries have outlawed domestic violence. Among Commonwealth countries, 47 have legislation, but 33 do not explicitly criminalise marital rape and only nine offer broad protections for LGBT people.
