He resigned from the party last month. The city of Joburg's finance MMC referred to the upcoming secret ballot election on 28 November as a "competition". All political parties are welcome to put forward a candidate for the election. READ: John Steenhuisen elected as DA interim leader Ngobeni attributes the successes of Mashaba to the "pact" between the DA, the EFF and the five coalition partners. He says that the coalition between the DA, the EFF and the coalition parties will continue with the tasks that they have already agreed on. Ngobeni says there is no agreement between the EFF and the DA, it is "a coalition of a special type". "In all cases, we have resolved that we must be able to sit down and negotiate".
