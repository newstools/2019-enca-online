If the ANC continues to zig-zag on e-tolls, it will be punished at the 2021 elections. This is the warning from Cosatu. It's promising to mobilise Gauteng residents. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu is planning to take the fight against e-tolls public. It has begun to mobilize Gauteng residents in the case that the ANC does not remove e-tolls. The intended strike will include the barricading of all the toll roads in Gauteng. READ: No decision on e-tolls yet "These roads are not provincial roads, they're national. The national government must come to the party," said Cosatu Gauteng chairperson, Amos Monyela. Monyela said the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula did not consult with Cosatu over the matter. Earlier in the year, there seemed to be a shift in attitude from the ANC and they seemed to be making a turn away from e-tolls. However, it seems as though e-tolls are still on the horizon for Gauteng province. READ: Outa predicts e-tolls will stay ANC has already shed 12-percent of votes in the previous election.
