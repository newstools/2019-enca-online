Many frustrated Himeville residents have been without water since the beginning of October, while Underberg's taps ran dry for two weeks. READ: Water restrictions remain in place: Rand Water Last month, the district municipality spent close to R10-million on a key water pump upgrade to cope with increased demand.
Harry Gwala District Municipality Water Services executive director, Dumisani Gqiba said, "to switch off from one system to another is actually very complicated, but I think it's going to be easier now."
It has been more than complicated -- it's a disaster that left residents without running water. After two weeks, Underberg's water supply was restored, but not Himeville's because the current system (which is expected to be completely upgraded within the next year) feeds Himeville via Underberg. There are health concerns, too. READ: Klipfontein residents beg government to open reservoir taps Residents are accusing the municipality of not being transparent.
The head of water services acknowledges it has failed the community but insists every attempt has been made to rectify the situation. Despite the situation, no one is likely to be held responsible. 
The municipality is promising to fully restore the water supply in the coming days. Meanwhile, a petition for the removal of the local mayor has already garnered close to 2,000 signatures.
