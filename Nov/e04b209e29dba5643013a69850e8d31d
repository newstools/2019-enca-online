South African activist for women's and indigenous people's rights Sizani Ngubane. GENEVA - A Yemeni lawyer who exposed secret prisons and torture, a Mexican champion fighting femicide and a South African women's rights activist were nominated for a top human rights prize. This marks the first time that the Martin Ennals Award jury has presented three women finalists to be in the running for the prestigious award. Among the finalists for the award -- often referred to as the Nobel Prize for human rights -- is Sizani Ngubane, a 73-year-old South African activist for women's and indigenous people's rights. She began her career as an activist with the ANC, before going on to found the Rural Women's Movement (RWM), which works against gender-based violence and for women's rights to land, education, property and inheritance. The other nominees are 42-year-old Yemeni lawyer Huda Al-Sarari and Norma Ledezma, a 53-year-old Mexican human rights activist. The Geneva-based Martin Ennals Foundation is named after the first secretary-general of Amnesty International, who died in 1991. The prize is judged by 10 leading rights groups, including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch. The winner will be announced in Geneva on 19 February 2020.
