The national consumer probe showed around 46 Ford Kugas caught fire. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Ford has been slapped with a R35-million fine for selling defective cars, which were found to be prone to catching alight. These incidents were between 2015 and 2017. One of the incidents resulted in the death of Reshall Jimmy in Wildnerness in the Western Cape. Owners of 56 Ford Kugas that caught alight due to the manufacturer's fault will now receive a payout of R50,000. The compensation is on top of a payout for each owner of the market value of their vehicle. READ: Ford SA to increase workforce by 25% The National Consumer Commission (NCC), in finding that fault lay with Ford, has imposed the biggest penalty in its existence. "If a consumer who is Ford Kuga burnt believes that she is entitled to compensation in excess of R50 000 then that consumer may file a claim against Ford motor company in terms of section 61 of the CPA," said acting NCC commissioner, Thezi Mabuza.
