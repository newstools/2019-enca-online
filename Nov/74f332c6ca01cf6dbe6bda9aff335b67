ABIDJAN - Police in Ivory Coast seized 200 tonnes of fake medicines in Abidjan this week, arresting four suspects including one Chinese national, the gendarmerie told AFP Saturday. READ: Fake medicines flourish in Africa despite killing thousands The haul included fake medicines and drugs that were not-full strength, packed into a two-storey house that also had a basement, said a spokesman. "In the house, all the rooms contained medicines and sometimes there was only just space to move." There were all sorts of medicines and a lot of them had Chinese packaging, he added. Around 42 percent of medicines circulating in sub-Saharan Africa are fake, making it the region hardest hit worldwide by this trafficking which is controlled by organised crime.

But according to the World Health Organization (WHO), fake medicines cause 100,000 deaths a year in Africa.
