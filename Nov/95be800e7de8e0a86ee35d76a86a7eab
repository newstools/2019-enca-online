CAPE TOWN - It's plain sailing for a boat-building company in the heart of one of Cape Town's oldest neighbourhoods. International customers are queueing up for its custom-made yachts. Orders are already chock-a-block for its top-of-the-range vessels. 25 years ago, John Robertson and the late Jerry Caine set wind to their sails by starting this boat company in the heart of humble Woodstock. "We are all South Africans here. The folks building the boats are from the local area, from Woodstock and around," said general managing director Peter Gilliam. "They have a craft they have a trade, they come through generations." Before the vessels are exported to their respective owners in the Caribbean, Mediterranean and South-East Asia, it will take these highly-skilled craftswomen and men -- ranging from carpenters to plumbers, mechanics to laminators -- to pull it off. These beauties can cost up to R25-million a pop, a hefty fee that would leave many shipwrecked.
