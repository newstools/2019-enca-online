Lessons under trees, lack of water and electricity, and pit latrines are a reality for many. READ: Pit toilets a priority, says Ramaphosa "We had to give ourselves the opportunity to celebrate the significant gains since the promulgation of norms and standards, the advocacy of learners, members of Equal Education have made substantial gains for addressing the backlog for school infrastructure," said Equal Education's Noncedo Madubedube. Madubedube said while gains have been made, the Department of Education has missed some of their own deadlines when it comes to infrastructure. Basic services including electricity access, adequate sanitation, and the elimination of pit latrines, and perimeter fencing are still not available at all schools.
