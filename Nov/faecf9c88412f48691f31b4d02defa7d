JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is expected to brief the media on the Tax Administration Act of 2012. The Tax Act has recently come into light as the Public Protector wants to subpoena former President Jacob Zuma’s tax information. This as part of an investigation into monies allegedly received by Zuma from a security company, Royal Security. SARS on Monday filed an urgent application to prohibit Mkhwebane from obtaining the records.
