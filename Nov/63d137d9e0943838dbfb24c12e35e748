JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) says its future hangs in the balance after its workers went on strike to demand higher wages and protest planned job cuts which forced the state-owned carrier to cancel all its flights. SAA, which has not turned a profit since 2011 and is reliant on state bailouts, says the walkout will cost it R50-million per day. Here is a brief history of SAA and details about its operations. HISTORY * 1934: Began operations after the government took over assets and liabilities of Union Airways and renamed it South African Airways. * 1945: SAA introduced its first inter-continental service from Johannesburg with stops in Nairobi, Khartoum, Cairo, Castel Benito (Tripoli) and Bournemouth. The trip took 34-hours. * 1986: Due to economic sanctions linked to apartheid, flights to New York were suspended in November 1986. The United States also withdrew from its landing rights in South Africa. * 1997: SAA announced a new corporate identity with colours of South Africa's new rainbow national flag on its aircraft tail. * 2000s: SAA entered into Africa's biggest jetliner deal by placing an order for 41 new Airbus aircraft for $3.5-billion. * June 2019: CEO Vuyani Jarana resigns saying his turnaround strategy for the loss-making airline was being undermined by a lack of state funding and too much bureaucracy. * September 2019: SAA says a government cash injection of R5.5-billion approved for the 2019/20 financial year is expected at the end of the month but it still needs more money. * October 2019: SAA is open to outside investment and in talks with a number of potential partners, President Cyril Ramaphosa says.
