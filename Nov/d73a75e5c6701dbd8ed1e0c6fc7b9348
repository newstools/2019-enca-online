Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - 80 Muslim graves have been desecrated in Cape Town. Headstones at the Mowbray Muslim Cemetry removed from new graves and rearranged in apparent cult-like symbols. The Muslim Judicial Council says it's shocked and has approached UCT’s religious department to help decipher the symbols. Gravediggers said when they left work the day before, everything was still in place. WATCH: KZN farmer accused of desecrating graves “When we got here we discovered what was like a big cross they made with tombstones that were here they took out the tombstones and made a cross. "And inside the holes that we still had to use, they took three stones and made like a triangle,” said burial worker, Dawood Brink. It’s unclear whether the desecration of these graves has anything to do with Halloween. “What I am thinking what the people were doing, is Satanism. People who don’t believe in Allah there is no God to them,” added Brink.
