Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - "I'll quit," said the JMPD police chief if the next mayor doesn’t support his department. Herman Mashaba will be vacating his post on 27 November, following his recent resignation. Police chief David Tembe said their efforts will be futile if there's no political backing. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says it’s winning the fight. But Tembe says he’ll call it quits if political support seizes, “let me make it very clear I will go. I don’t want to be something else I’ll make it very clear. Either the support or if there is no support that’s it and I’ll just feel sorry for the officers.” On his way out, Mashaba is still singing the praises of the police force. “I challenge anyone to do a study, to compare JMPD with other agencies including SAPS, JMPD is by far the most effective.” WATCH: Mashaba announces his next move Meanwhile, Mashaba’s appealed to his successor to continue supporting the JMPD. It’s still unclear who'll be taking over from Mashaba.
