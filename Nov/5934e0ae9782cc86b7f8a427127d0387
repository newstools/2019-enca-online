DURBAN - The opening of a R380-million promenade extension is set to raise Durban’s standing on the global tourism stage. The day’s activities kicked off with an 8km fun run from Blue Lagoon to Ushaka Marine World. eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda led the event.   "Whenever you take a walk here, you are able to interact with different people," said Kaunda. "You take your family, you stage a walk, you stage a picnic and this is exactly what we thought of when we created such a facility. "It will enhance our tourism as a city”.  Economic Development MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube says small businesses will benefit greatly from the development. “We are already reaping rewards from this promenade," Dube-Ncube said. "As you would see there is going to be small businesses that are going to be opening here from now on moving into the festive season.”
