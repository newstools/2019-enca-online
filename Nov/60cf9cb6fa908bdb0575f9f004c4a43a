The utility says this will allow the municipalities to reduce their debt. "Eskom recognises that to indefinitely stop the supply of electricity services may cause undue hardship to consumers and members of the community and may adversely affect the delivery of other services," the power utility said in a statement. "In view of this and in order to minimize any hardship to consumers and any members of the community, Eskom will hold its electricity supply services in a regulated pattern. This will allow members of the community and consumers the opportunity to make alternative arrangements for the scheduled periods." Eskom has warned that it could entirely terminate electricity supply if they fail to improve their debt.
