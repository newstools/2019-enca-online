File: Sam Bird fought through from fifth at the start to continue his record of winning in every season of the all-electric championship dating back to the first in 2014/15. RIYADH - Britain's Sam Bird won the opening race of the Formula E season in Saudi Arabia for Envision Virgin Racing on Friday, with series debutants Porsche and Mercedes making immediate appearances on the podium. The 32-year-old fought through from fifth at the start to continue his record of winning in every season of the all-electric championship dating back to the first in 2014/15. The win was also Bird's ninth in Formula E, the third most of any driver. Germany's Andre Lotterer finished second for the Porsche team with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne taking third place for Mercedes -- with Audi claiming bragging rights also as powertrain provider to Bird's team. The Diriyah circuit on the outskirts of Riyadh hosts a second race on Saturday. "I think it's the power of the beard that did that," Bird joked over the radio, alluding to his new look for the 14 race season. "We've done, quite frankly, an amazing job in the off-season. "Last year was difficult and I went through a little bit of a transformation. A lot of thinking and mental stuff. Physically, I'm fitter than ever before, massive weight loss," he added.
