JOHANNESBURG - Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has encouraged South Africans to seek to understand and learn more about other cultures, languages and religions. "We need unity now more than ever before. I has got to be something that each one of us worries about on a daily basis. The simplest way to start is to learn more about or know more about one another. As a South African you've got to want to know other languages," he said. READ: Chief Justice calls on SA to contribute to ending injustice "We can't just be learning English.
