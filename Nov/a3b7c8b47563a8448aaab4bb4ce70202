File: Several opposition parties have called on the national government to place SAA on business rescue. CAPE TOWN - It’s time to bite the bullet and seek a private equity partner for SAA. Debating the recent strike action in the National Assembly on Tuesday, several opposition parties called on government to place the airline under business rescue. “Instead of bailing out SAA, SAA should be bailing out South Africans," said the IFP's Mkhuleko Hlengwa.

DA MP Alf Lees said: "Who in their right mind demands any salary increase from a bankrupt employer."

EFF representatives disagreed. Nazier Paulsen said it is correct for workers to unite and fight against retrenchments. "The failures of SAA can't be blamed on ordinary workers," said Paulsen.
While SAA's management is battling to pay its bills, it still has to return to Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts to offer a plan of action for submitting outstanding financial statements, which it has not done for the past two years.
