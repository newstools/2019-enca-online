The Tshwane Entertainment Collective has written to the Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa to object his inclusion at the anti-xenophobic concert. In the letter penned to the minister, the group raised a number of concerns including the lack of financial support for artists from the area and the inclusion of Burna Boy in the line-up. "We first inquired to the minister and to the department to say, what is this all about? How is this happening? How are you guys supporting this?

In September, Burna Boy caused a stir on social media after saying he would boycott the country because his fellow Nigerians were being treated badly. In a now-deleted tweet, Burna Boy said he would never set foot in the country again unless the government "wakes the f**k up and really performs a miracle". He also told local rapper AKA to beef up his security, before giving him the middle finger.
