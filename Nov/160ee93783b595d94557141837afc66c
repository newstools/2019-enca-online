The eShowe family that dropped off a corpse at Old Mutual says they were just fed up with the insurer. DURBAN - The Mtshali family from KwaDukuza has laid to rest their uncle after taking drastic measures to prove his death to Old Mutual. Sifiso Mtshali died on 7 November. His family brought their application to Old Mutual for the payout. The insurer said they would need further assessments, and subsequently, the usual 48-hour claim period lapsed. The family said they brought the body to Old Mutual's offices in an act of desperation.

"After two hours we went back to the administrators and again they asked us to wait for three more hours," said Mhlongo. "We couldn't wait anymore so we told them we'd just make things easier for them and bring the body so they can do their assessments." The insurer said the incident is regrettable and isolated, as the specific claim needed further assessments. It said it strives to pay claims speedily and within 48 hours, once all requirements are met. Family members are said to be traumatised and emotional and will be visited by social workers. They said they didn't expect the video to go viral and this has put further strain on the family. Old Mutual pays out a family only after they take a corpse to the insurance company's office.
