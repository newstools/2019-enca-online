Western Cape Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa confirmed that four people, in their 30's, were killed in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It is believed that suspects broke down a door of the house, fired shots and fled the scene. Potelwa also said there is a strong possibility that these killings could be gang-related. "I must indicate ... this area has been fairly quiet for the past two-and-a-half months and to us it came as a shock that there was a shooting in the area." Members of the anti-gang unit have been deployed to the area. Watch the video above for more on this story.  Three men and a woman have been shot dead in Cape Town's Mitchells Plain.
