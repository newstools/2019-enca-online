Alon Kowen says on his post: "Beluga Whale celebrating the Springboks victory somewhere close to the South Pole! Spot the Cape Town build Gemini Craft and the South African accents! The whale can be seen eagerly swimming up to the boat and waiting for the ball to be thrown, so he or she can collect the ball and give it back.
