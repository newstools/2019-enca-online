Former president Jacob Zuma will find out on Thursday if he can appeal a court decision condemning his tweet about Derek Hanekom. PIETERMARITZBURG - The legal wrangle between former president Jacob Zuma and former minister Derek Hanekom is back in court on Thursday. The KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg will rule on Zuma's bid for leave to appeal a judgment. The court previously found Zuma's tweet about Hanekom was false and defamatory.
