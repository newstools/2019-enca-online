He has decided to cut short an official state visit to Egypt, shortly after arriving on Tuesday morning. Ramaphosa: Load-shedding 'devastating for economy' There have been numerous calls for him to come back and deal with Eskom and the load-shedding that's harming the economy. The President is set to meet Eskom's executive management on Wednesday. Ramaphosa says the anger and frustration over load-shedding is understandable. He described the outages as devastating for the country and the economy. Eskom says load-shedding is likely to continue as the power utility battles with breakdowns at the Medupi Power Station.
