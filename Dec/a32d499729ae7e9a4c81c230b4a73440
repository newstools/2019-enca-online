File: eNCA has pulled its editorial and technical team from this weekend’s EFF elective conference. JOHANNESBURG - eNCA has taken a principled decision to stop covering this weekend’s EFF elective conference. This after the party barred several news organisations from covering the event. These, according to the SA National Editors Forum, include the Daily Maverick, Scorpio, amaBhungane and Rapport. eNCA has pulled its editorial and technical team from the conference in Johannesburg. Editor Jeremy Maggs says the EFF's decision is an attack on media freedom in the country and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. He says it’s regrettable the channel will not bring its audience news of the event. But eNCA has to take a firm stand on media freedom by showing solidarity with organisations barred from attending.
