JOHANNESBURG - Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi said her decision not to wear a wig while competing in the pageant was based on seeing the need to redefine beauty standards. Zozibini sat down with CNN Full Circle host Anderson Cooper and explained why it was important for her not to listen to people who encouraged her to wear a wig during the pageant. "When they said it to me at first, I was like no, I am not going to change my hair. But then I sat down and really thought about it.

The Eastern Cape beauty said changing her hair would've meant that she also did not believe that she was beautiful with her natural hair. "If I did put on artificial hair then that means I believe that I am not beautiful and I believe that women who look like me are not beautiful, which is why I thought, I am just going to go full-on the way that I am. "I see myself as beautiful as any other women and that is why I went on this way."
