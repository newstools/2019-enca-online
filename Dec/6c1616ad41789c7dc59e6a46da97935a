Eskom says it will continue to cut power supplies to residents who do not pay their electricity bills. Residents of Soweto collectively owe the power utility billions of rands. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom said it will continue to cut power supplies to residents who do not pay their electricity bills. Residents of Soweto collectively owe the power utility a total of R18.2-billion, which is reportedly almost half of the total local municipal debt owed to the electricity utility. 'Unfortunately, we cannot go on ... where we just watch where the residents are just consuming without us collecting the revenue and hence that is why we needed to implement our credit management strategies," said Eskom’s Client Service Senior Manager Daphne Mokwena.

Eskom has also begun converting conventional meters to prepaid meters, allowing residents to manage their electricity use. "We are saying that if customers are on prepaid then you can actually manage what you are consuming, as per your affordability but unfortunately most customers in Soweto are resisting this", added Mokwena. Mokwena says some residents continue to tamper with meters and buy electricity from 'ghost vendors'.
