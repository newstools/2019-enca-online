Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala is advising motorists to be vigilant on the roads as the festive season is in full swing. Zikalala sent his condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the crash on the R56 road between Ixopo and Umzimkhulu. Seven people including two children were killed. "Let us be careful, let us understand that the roads are used not only by yourself who is driving your own car, understand that there are other people," Zikalala said. "Let us be responsible, don't drive long-distance, if you drive for two hours, you must take a rest. Don't drive under the influence of alcohol."
