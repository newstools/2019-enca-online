PRETORIA - The battle for control of the capital city is set to continue on Thursday. The ANC and EFF voted out mayor Stevens Mokgalapa, the speaker and two other DA councillors during a special sitting earlier this month but, the High Court temporarily suspended this removal via an interim order. The legal battle now continues after being postponed on Tuesday when the ANC said it needed to go through papers filed by the DA. READ: ANC 'has proof' of DA corruption in Tshwane The ANC has filed many motions of no confidence against the DA-led administration in Tshwane, all which up to now have failed. This time, a sex tape, allegedly involving mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge, is what resulted in the latest vote.
During the no-confidence motion earlier this month, there was drama in the house.

If the court doesn't make a decision after Thursday's arguments, this leadership battle could last well into the new year.
