The matter was taken up by Parliament’s ethics committee but never concluded.

Last week, EFF leader Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi also found themselves in the dock on assault charges. It relates to an attack on a police officer at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Shivambu, meanwhile, will have to return to court on 28 January next year.
