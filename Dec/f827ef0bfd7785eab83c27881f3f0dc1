PRETORIA - Motorists are continuing to break laws this festive season. That's according to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, who's led another all-night roadblock in Limpopo focusing on overloading of vehicles. In total, 23 trailers were found to be unroadworthy and 15 were impounded. Operation Live Beyond December is an attempt to force people to comply with regulations.

"From what we see and the number of cars that are increasing in terms of those that are impounded, it's a clear demonstration that there is disrespect of the rule of law and the rules of the road," said Mbalula. With about 45 vehicles found not to be compliant in just under an hour of the roadblock, the Transport Department says operations like this are only going to intensify.
