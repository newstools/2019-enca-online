JOHANNESBURG - Interest rates must be cut to grow the economy. That's the view of Optimum Investment Group's economic advisor, Dr Roelof Botha. He says the Reserve Bank is not supporting the country's economic growth. "Their policy is totally out of synchronisation with most of our major trading partners," said Botha.

Botha said he looked at the change in policy when a new monetary policy committee was appointed after former governor Gill Marcus's departure. "Since then the average real prime rate has gone from 3 percent to more than 6 percent. That is an increase of more than 100 percent in the cost of capital and credit in real terms," said Botha. "It is absolutely incomprehensible." READ: Repo rate remains unchanged The Reserve Bank in November opted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent. Lowering the interest rate would likely weaken the rand, as it makes SA bonds less attractive to investors on the hunt for higher-yielding returns, analysts warned.
