Ramaphosa says sabotage resulted in 2,000 megawatts being lost from the grid READ: Num details how load-shedding sabotage would've happened The DA has outlined six steps it says government could immediately pursue to tackle the energy crisis. 1. Eskom must be immediately be split into two entities, one for generation and the other supply. Unlike the ANC’s proposal, these entities must be operated independently of each other. Allowing IPPs to generate and supply power to the grid will secure supply and bring down the cost of electricity through competition in the energy market. This must include renewable energy sources including wind, solar and hydro-electric power. The DA’s “Cheaper Electricity Bill” achieves exactly this and is currently before Parliament. it needs to be urgently passed. 2. Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe should at once sign permissions for Independent Power Producers to provide additional power to the grid via qualifying municipalities, in terms of Section 34 of the Electricity Regulation Act. He has the power to do so with the strike of a pen. If Mantashe will not do so, President Ramaphosa must instruct him to do so, or relieve him of his duties. 3. Eskom should be permitted to procure coal from any and all sources, and not be contractually bound to the current restricted supplier list. 4. Eskom must be sold diesel by PetroSA at a tax-free cost price. 5. All electricity consumers must be placed onto smart meters to collect electricity revenue on time. 6. Eskom employees must be declared an “essential service” in the economy and barred from going on strike.
