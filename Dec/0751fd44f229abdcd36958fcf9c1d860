White stones mark burial sites at the Potter's field on Hart Island in New York. NEW YORK -Â A once off-limits, eroding island in New York where more than a million people are buried in unmarked mass graves dug by prisoners is about to become more accessible. Often referred to as "island of the dead" or "jail for the dead," the islet has for over a century been run by the prisons department, which heavily restricts access. Hart Island, in the Long Island Sound tidal estuary, became a potter's field in 1869 after the city purchased it from a private landholder to bury unknown and indigent residents. Approximately 1,200 burials, some of unidentified people, still take place every year. Adults are buried in pine coffins stacked three deep; children five deep in plots of 1,000. Inmates from nearby Rikers Island, one of America's most notorious jails, are paid $1 an hour to bury the dead. Around half of the interred are young children, officials say. Last month, New York's city council voted to end prison control of Hart Island by transferring jurisdiction to its parks department, in a move hailed by activists. It also pledged to start regular ferry services. "It lifts the stigma of city burials," Melinda Hunt, who has been campaigning for three decades to make the cemetery more accessible, told AFP. Authorities first started permitting visits in 2007, although relatives were restricted to a gazebo away from the burial plots. After the city settled a lawsuit in 2015, relatives have been allowed to visit gravesites, albeit under controlled conditions and on the specified dates.
