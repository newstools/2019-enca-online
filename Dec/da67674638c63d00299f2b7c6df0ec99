Reece Hodge signed a new deal with Rugby Australia and the Melbourne Rebels. SYDNEY - Reece Hodge signed a new deal with Rugby Australia and the Melbourne RebelsÂ that sees the 25-year-old wing commit to the Wallabies through to the next World Cup in 2023. The versatile Hodge, who has 39 Test caps, has been trialled in different positions and most recently made two appearances on the wing in the Wallabies World Cup campaign in Japan, scoring a try and kicking a penalty in the pool win against Fiji. He made his Wallabies debut against New Zealand in Wellington in 2016. His last appearance was in the quarter-final defeat to England in October. "I've only ever been coached by (Michael) Cheika at international level," said Hodge. "So it will definitely have a different feel with Dave Rennie and his new coaching staff coming on board and I'm really excited about the future." Rugby Australia director Scott Johnson said Hodge would now be able to focus on the 2023 World Cup in France. "He is capable of playing across almost every position in the backline, has some speed and a strong skill set," Johnson said. "He is a world-class goal kicker that can be a quality asset for the Wallabies for years to come. "He's had great experience already with the Wallabies and has an opportunity to build on that and set his sights on the next World Cup."
