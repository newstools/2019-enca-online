NEW YORK - Eight-year-old Ryan Kaji earned $26-million in 2019 on his YouTube channel, making him the highest-paid creator on the platform, according to a list published on Wednesday by Forbes magazine. Kaji, whose real name is Ryan Guan, was already the video platform's highest earner in 2018, with $22-million, according to Forbes. His channel "Ryan's World," launched in 2015 by Ryan's parents, is only three years old but already has 22.9 million subscribers. Initially called "Ryan ToysReview," the channel mostly consisted of "unboxing" videos -- videos of the young star opening boxes of toys and playing with them. Several of the videos have racked up more than one billion views, and the channel has received almost 35 billion views since its creation, according to data from the analytics website Social Blade. Recently, the channel was renamed after a consumer advocacy organization, Truth in Advertising, filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about it. Truth in Advertising accused the channel of not clearly denoting which videos had been sponsored, meaning brands paid for the video to feature their products. The channel has also evolved as Ryan ages, now offering more educational videos in addition to the toys.
