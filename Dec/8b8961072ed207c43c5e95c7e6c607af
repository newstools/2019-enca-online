British author J. K. Rowling attends HBO's "Finding The Way" world premiere at Hudson Yards on December 11, 2019 in New York City. LONDON -Â J.K. Rowling on Thursday backed a British woman who lost her job for tweeting that people cannot alter their biological sex after she lost a legal case against her employer. Maya Forstater was sacked from the Centre for Global Development, an international think-tank, after tweeting her opposition to a British government proposal that would make it easier for transgender people to change their legal sex. Some colleagues raised concerns that the tweets were transphobic, a charge Forstater rejected. She has said she supports everyone's human rights but maintains that it is not possible to change sex.

"Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who'll have you. Live your best life in peace and security," Rowling tweeted. "But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya." Rowling, who has nearly 15 million Twitter followers, got thousands of likes and retweets on the social media platform, with some praising her for having the courage to share her views. But others criticised her for the tweet. "I love JK Rowling. But I won't ignore it when she openly tweets things that are harmful to the trans community," tweeted Tessa Netting.
