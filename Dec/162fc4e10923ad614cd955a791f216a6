JOHANNESBURG - Walter Sisulu’s role in the Rivonia Trial of the 1960s has been brought to new life through virtual reality. It’s part of the Apartheid Museum’s “Reality Check” exhibition being hosted in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the French government. The VR film, Accused Number Two, uses restored audio recordings of the trial to put the viewer right inside the Palace of Justice, where Sisulu, Mandela and other struggle heroes were tried for sabotage. The 256 hours of audio recordings of the hearings were recently restored by France’s National Audio-visual Institute. Extracts from these precious audio archives have been set to striking animation in an award-winning 15-minute film, directed by Nicolas Champeaux and Gilles Porte. The 'Reality Check' exhibition also tells the broader life story of Sisulu. It runs at the Apartheid Museum until the end of March 2020.
