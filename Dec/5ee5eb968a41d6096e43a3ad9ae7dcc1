Since England’s arrival on the 14th of December, some players have either sat out training, warm-up matches, or both. Hloni Mtimkulu has been following both teams’ preparations ahead of Thursday.

JOHANNESBURG - The warm-up fixture between England and South Africa's A-side was downgraded from a first class fixture to a three-day friendly tour match, due to the potential absence of some English players because of illness. Bowlers Chris Overton and Dominic Bess have been flown in as cover. Despite the difficulties, England coach Chris Silverwood is pleased with how his side fared at the weekend. “If you look at it from a first innings runs point of view, we’re continuing to build those methods; create good habits there. From an overs perspective, I mean Jimmy and all the rest of the bowlers are finding their rhythm, which is great.” Silverwood says England are still weighing up the option of playing a specialist spinner in the first Test. “We’ve got the resources ... and we’re not definitely going down the all-seam road, it is something we’ve got to discuss the next few days.” The first Test between South Africa and England starts on Thursday.
