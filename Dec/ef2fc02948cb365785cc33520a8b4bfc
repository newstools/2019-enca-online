But what is it that South Africa needs to do to solve the electricity crisis?

Trollip said the problems South Africa is facing now has been over ten years in the making through neglect, incompetent and corrupt governance, and looting through state capture.

So we're not respecting our overall governance mechanisms, at the top." Trollip said the best way of going forward will be to stabilise the existing power structures and gradually deescalate and decommission coal-based power.
