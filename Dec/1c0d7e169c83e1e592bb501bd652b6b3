JOHANNESBURG - If SAA won't go to Parliament, then Parliament will go to SAA. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) is scheduled to visit the airline on Thursday. This after SAA failed to appear before the committee last week, to answer for failing to submit its financial report for two years. READ: How far can SAA fly? Scopa chairperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, says the airline has not been forthcoming. “The fundamental issue is that there is none compliance with the law. The law is very clear, financial statements must be submitted by the 3rd of September. SAA appeared before us on the 13th and explained why they have not submitted. We were not satisfied with that explanation because amongst other things they has anchored their outlook to not submit on a legal opinion,” said Hlengwa. “An opinion is an opinion and the law is law, and it is fact… SAA did not submit it. Parliamentary legal services looked into the issues and we’re certain that there is no two-ways about submission, SAA must submit,” he added.
