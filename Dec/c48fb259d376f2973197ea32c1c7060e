The weapons were stolen during a break-in at a military base in Lyttelton, south of Pretoria, earlier this week. READ: SANDF used to fight Cape Town's gangs. Why it's a bad idea SA National Defence Union Secretary, Pikkie Greef, says the incident seems to have been an inside job. “Our sources indicate that the weapons have been recovered and that the people involved have been detained for questioning,” Greef said. “Indications are that it is an inside job. It is impossible to go into a base and get 19 weapons; one would need access to the keys and the safe where the weapons are kept. There are very strict control measures.”
