Actress and fashion designer Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa. JOHANNESBURG - Local actress and fashion designer Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa has once again called for privacy after her husband DJ Black Coffee addressed their divorce in an interview. According to City Press, DJ Black Coffee said he had initially asked for a separation via an email when he realised that things were not working out between them. "In April this year, I sent a lengthy email to her in which I suggested that we should separate and she should find a place to stay with the kids and I would pay for it. I did that because I wanted us to improve our marriage and to be more involved with them. But she declined the offer," he told the publication.
