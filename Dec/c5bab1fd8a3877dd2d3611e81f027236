Veronika¬†Didusenko was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018, but was dethroned after the organisers found out that she has a five-year-old son and disqualified from going on to compete for the Miss World title. KIEV - A former Miss Ukraine stripped of her crown and barred from competing for Miss World because she is a mother has launched legal action against the contest, demanding a rule change. "We demand a change of rules, @missworld", allowing all women to participate, 24-year-old Veronika Didusenko said on her Instagram on Monday after launching a campaign called #righttobeamother. Dear friends, I am happy to share the exciting news with you. Today #righttobeamother has made a huge leap forward. I have launched a legal challenge against @MissWorld and this marks the new phase in our joint fight for justice. ‚†Ä I am proud to be represented by Ravi Naik, Human Rights Lawyer of the Year 2018, and Leading Counsel Marie Demitriou QC. Ravi represents clients in some of the world‚Äôs most high profile cases. This includes the first case against #CambridgeAnalytica for political profiling and claims against Facebook for their data practices. Marie Demitriou was a barrister on the legal team acting for South African athlete Caster Semenya who was subjected to sex testing following her victory at the 2009 World Championships. ‚†Ä We say that under the #EqualityAct 2010 the entry policy operated by #MissWorld is discriminatory on various grounds, namely marital status, and pregnancy and maternity. The Equality Act protects against discrimination based on certain characteristics, including marriage, maternity and sex. The reason I was not allowed to compete in Miss World  after winning the title #MissUkraine is because I had been married and have a child. Denying me the chance of competing on those bases breaches those protections against discrimination. ‚†Ä I don‚Äôt want the crown back. I want to get the rules changed for wider society. These rules are a systemic, widespread and international policy that results in discrimination on large scale across many countries. ‚†Ä This year the 69th Miss World Final returns to London on 14 December 2019. We believe it is the right moment for @MissWorld to introduce the change. ‚†Ä I am really glad to see that our story has resonated with the UK national media such as @dailymail,  @telegraph,  @thesun, @skynews, @thetimes, @bbcnews, @bbcnewsbeat, @dailymirrorüåç ‚†Ä Photo credit: David McHugh/Brighton Pictures A post shared by  Veronika Didusenko (@veronika_didusenko) on Nov 30, 2019 at 7:08am PST Didusenko was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018, but was dethroned after the organisers found out that she has a five-year-old son and disqualified from going on to compete for the Miss World title. "The reason I was not allowed to compete in Miss World after winning the title¬† #MissUkraine¬†is because I had been married and have a child," she wrote on Instagram. The rules of Miss World ban mothers and married women from taking part in the beauty pageant and oblige the contestants to sign a corresponding agreement. Didusenko accused organisers of "discrimination" and said that global beauty pageants "seem to be stuck in the dark ages". "I don't want the crown back," she wrote on her Instagram page on Sunday. "I want to get the rules changed for wider society." Didusenko has launched legal action in London claiming Miss World organisers are breaching the terms of the Equality Act of 2010 that protects against discrimination based on certain characteristics, including marriage, maternity and gender. There has not yet been any comment from Miss World on the issue. This year, the Miss World final will take place in London on 14 December. Ukraine will be represented by Margaryta Pasha, a law student. Miss World is the world's oldest beauty pageant, first held in Britain in 1951.
