The party believes at least two of its councillors voted for the ANC in Johannesburg. The ANC's Geoff Makhubo was voted as the new Joburg Mayor on Wednesday unseating DA in the metro. Steenhuisen said they will be consequences. READ: Makhubo takes Joburg reins with a cloud over his head “The biggest obstacle to us getting into power will often lie with ill-discipline within our ranks...we will be taking very strong action against individuals who behave in an ill-disciplined way,” said Steenhuisen. He says such actions widen cracks within the party.
