There's seems to be confusion after part of the supporting structure of the M1 South bridge at the Booysens off-ramp in Johannesburg collapsed yesterday. JRA Acting Managing Director Siyabonga Nodu spoke to us. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG  - The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) says the M1 South bridge at the Booysens off-ramp in Johannesburg does not need to be closed. This after part of the stormwater drainage system of the bridge caved-in on Christmas Day. WATCH: Part of M1 South bridge collapses JRA Acting Managing Director Siyabonga Nodu says even if you removed the paving blocks and sand the bridge will still stand. "What needs to be done now is we will repair the section that is under the bridge as well as clean and fix the stormwater drainage system." Engineers conducted a full inspection on Thursday and concluded the bridge's structure is still sound and safe for use. WATCH: Gauteng clamps down on dodgy vehicles The agency says it will continue to monitor the bridge until it is fully rehabilitated. The JRA has also said it is prioritising bridges that need attention. Watch the full interview with JRA Acting Managing Director Siyabonga Nodu above.
