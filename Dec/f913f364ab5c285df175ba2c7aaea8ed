Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has been asked by the Cabinet to ensure Eskom's new CEO Andre De Ruyter starts sooner. De Ruyter is due to start at Eskom on 15 January 2020. He is tasked with getting Eskom out of the energy crisis it's currently facing. Mthembu was briefing the media on the outcomes of the Cabinet briefing. WATCH: Is Andre de Ruyter up to the task? The embattled Eskom began rolling power cuts in the beginning of December, which led to Stage 6 load-shedding for the first time. Eskom blamed this on sabotage. Mthembu said de Ruyter will deal with issues at Eskom. The National Treasury has allocated R59-billion to Eskom over the next two years.
