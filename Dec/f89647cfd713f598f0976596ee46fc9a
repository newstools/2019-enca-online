Geoff Makhubo takes the Johannesburg mayoral chain with a cloud over his head. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg’s new Mayor Geoff Makhubo wants to provide free water, improve service delivery to the poor – and has promised a new budget. Makhubo, was elected mayor in a council sitting on Wednesday. “Food banks that provided social safety nets to the poorest, have been stopped,” Makhubo said. “Access to free basic water, six kiloliters of water universally, have been stopped. This will be reinstated and is a matter of priority.” READ: DA disappointed some of its councillors voted with the ANC Makhubo's plans will need council approval and even with his coalition partners – this is not guaranteed. Standing in his way is a stalemate at council, where the ANC does not have a majority of seats – and the EFF has threatened to boycott his budget. “We are not fazed by the fact that we might not pass budget,” Makhubo said. “We are confident that everyone will have a stake in that budget, and that budget will go through. The threat that we will not pass the budget, for me, is politicking.”
