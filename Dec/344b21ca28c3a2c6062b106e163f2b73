Rover was allegedly hurt by his owner in an attempt to "test his strength". BLOEMFONTEIN - The Bloemfontein SPCA is in the process of opening a case against a 17-year-old boy who allegedly broke his dog's leg while trying to see "how strong he was". The organisation was called into the Baywater area on Sunday after someone heard a dog crying. "We found a puppy lying in a pool of blood and hardly able to move. We struggled to get to the dog as a 17-year-old tried to fight us off. "We contacted the authorities to help us to get to the dog. While we were waiting for the authorities we tried talking to the boy and asked him what had happened and why he was fighting us off," the SPCA Bloemfontein said in a post on Facebook.

So he started by lifting heavy metals and breaking a broom stick, but it was not enough. He then Googled how strong bones were and what amount of force can break it. "He then called his dog and started to press on the dog’s leg. The leg eventually broke with such a force that the bone had punctured through the skin." SPCA Bloemfontein inspector Duan Matthee said the organisation will be laying a charge of animal cruelty against the boy on Wednesday. Matthee said the dog is recovering well after it underwent surgery on Monday. "He will definitely make it. The surgery went well and we are grateful for all the donations we have received," said Matthee.
