LOS ANGELES - Finding love is never easy, as actress Sharon Stone discovered when she was blocked on dating app Bumble after multiple users reported her account as fake. "I went on the @bumble dating sight and they closed my account. Some users reported that it couldn't possibly be me!" the actress tweeted early Monday. "Is being me exclusionary? Don't shut me out of the hive," Stone joked, adding a bee emoji to play into Bumble's hexagonal honeycomb logo. She also tweeted a screenshot of the message from Bumble, which said she was blocked after the website received "several reports" her profile was fake.
