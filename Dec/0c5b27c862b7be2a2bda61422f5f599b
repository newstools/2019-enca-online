The Zozi haircut is taking the world by storm after she was crowned Miss Universe. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi was widely praised for gracing the global stage with her short, natural hair. Tunzi said she wants to be a role model for young children who look like her. She said when she grew up, people who looked like her were not considered beautiful. Now, the man behind her famous hairstyle says people are asking to copy her. WATCH: I'm not going to change my hair, says Zozibini Tunzi “It’s been a local thing and people from locally and Africa they are quite proud of what’s been a girl to win a pageant to win with those kind of looks. It has always been a pageant that a girl must have long hair or weave,” said celebrity hairstylist Jawad Maphoto. In a recent interview with Anderson Cooper, Tunzi said some people encouraged her to wear a wig for the Miss Universe pageant but she said no because she wants to redefine beauty standards. "If I did put on artificial hair then that means I believe that I am not beautiful and I believe that women who look like me are not beautiful, which is why I thought, I am just going to go full-on the way that I am', said Tunzi.
