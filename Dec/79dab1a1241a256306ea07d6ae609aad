JOHANNESBURG - We're just a few hours away from saying goodbye to 2019 - Fireworks have become a prerequisite in almost every celebration ushering in the new year but it's equally important to be careful when firing up. READ: New firework by-laws for City of Johannesburg Firework distributors advise customers not to buy fireworks from unregulated hawkers as there is no recourse if there are injuries. The public is encouraged to make sure children are supervised if they are being allowed to use fireworks. People celebrating are also advised to make sure there is plenty of space between them and the pyrotechnics. Revellers in Johannesburg who choose to ignite fireworks on New Year's Eve will be limited to lighting them between 11 pm and 1 am. Those who do not comply will be hit with a fine of R1,500.
