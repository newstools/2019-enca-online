JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says he has no shame about winning Saturday's match against Maritzburg United. The Brazilians came from a goal down to beat Maritzburg United 2-1 in the Telkom Knockout final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. The Team of Choice striker Judas Moseamedi was denied what looked like a legitimate goal deep into injury time to bring the score to 2-2.

I don't know if it's offside or not, If it's not, I benefitted and I have no shame." "Some people have been getting all these benefits... I want them for five games in a row and I have no shame about that," he said. Sundowns won their first domestic cup since 2015.
