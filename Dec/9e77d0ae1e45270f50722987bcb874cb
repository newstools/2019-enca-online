JOHANNESBURG - Eastern Cape initiation schools where deaths have occurred have been suspended after the deaths of more than 20 initiates. The CRL Rights Commission is also raising concerns over criminality and kidnappings that take place at some of the schools.
The commission has issued a stern warning to initiation schools. At schools in the Eastern Cape where deaths have occurred, the commission has taken action. READ: 18 initiates dead, 100 rescued from bogus school This is not the first time the commission has taken this decision.
In 2017, the organisation suspended some initiation schools in Gauteng for two years. The commission says since then, there have been fewer deaths and acts of criminality.

"The CRL Rights Commission strongly believes that these challenges and deaths could have been prevented," said commission chairperson Professor Luka David Mosoma. "The CRL Rights Commission calls upon all the law enforcement agencies to bring to book those who have been responsible for the loss of lives."
The commission says if initiation schools don't adhere to their suspensions, police will be called in.
A call is also being made to traditional leaders and parents to ensure boys are safe at initiation schools.
