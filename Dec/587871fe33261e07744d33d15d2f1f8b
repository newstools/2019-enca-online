JOHANNESBURG - Former Media24 executive and teacher, Willem Breytenbach, will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday on a sexual assault charge. He was tracked down in Hartenbos in the Southern Cape earlier this week, following a claim by Deon Wiggett that Breytenbach raped him 20 years ago. It’s believed several more men have come forward with similar claims and have opened cases with police. Breytenbach was nabbed and transported from his mother’s home in the Southern Cape to Cape Town police station in handcuffs. READ: Accused sex offender Willem Breytenbach arrested Despite reports of a suicide attempt last week, police have confirmed Breytenbach says he will cooperate. Allegations of sexual misconduct first came to light in Wiggett’s series of podcasts in which he outed Breytenbach and detailed their interactions. Other complainants reportedly say they were victims of his alleged lewd acts when he was still a teacher, going as far back as 1997. Breytenbach immediately closed his businesses when the claims were made and went underground. Police aren't excluding that further charges might be added when he appears in court on Thursday
