Logan Maistry speaks to eNCA about Vicki Momberg's release from prison. The former real estate agent was imprisoned for repeatedly using the k-word. JOHANNESBURG - Convicted racist Vicki Momberg is a free woman this morning. The former real estate agent was found guilty of crimen injuria in 2017, after using the k-word repeatedly after a smash-and-grab incident. Momberg was sentenced to three years, with one year suspended. She served four months in prison after qualifying for the remission of sentence recently announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. "In this instance, the inmate was sentenced by the court to a sentence of two years' imprisonment and the inmate then qualified and from the 6th of November until yesterday [27 December 2019] the inmate served sentence and then following the remission the sentence expired and the inmate was then released from custody," said Deputy Commissioner at Department of Correctional Services, Logan Maistry.
