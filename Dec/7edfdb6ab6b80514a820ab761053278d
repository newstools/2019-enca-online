READ: Suspect arrested in connection with Ramabulana's murder Ramaphosa says sex offenders’ days are numbered. "All these people once arrested, jailed and sentenced, they should not be in jail and enjoy life there," Ramaphosa said. “They should be subjected to harsh labour, the harshest of labour in prison because what they are doing to society is even beyond words to talk about. "The hurt, the harm that they cause to the families of the victims and society also has to bear the cost of having them in prison and some of them clearly come out of prison without any sign of remorse and then continue to perpetrate these acts again. "Our coming here now means that we will have to double up our effort to do everything that we can to be more vigilant on the case of abuse of women and children, and the rape and killing of the women of our country."
