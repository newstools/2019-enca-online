Eskom's Medupi Power Station near Lephalale in Limpopo. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says it has moved stage 4 load-shedding to stage 6 on Monday. The power utility said stage 6 will be implemented from 6pm. “This follows a technical problem at Medupi Power Station impacting additional generation supply. The heavy rains caused coal handling problems at several power stations,” Eskom said. Earlier, Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer says the recent excessive rain is making things very difficult for the power utility. READ: Stage 2 load-shedding continues "We have not recovered. We lost another two units over the weekend due to unplanned breakdowns. Stage 2 will continue. At this point in time, we believe that towards the end of the week the situation will improve."  On Sunday night Eskom extended power cuts beyond the 11pm cut-off time. READ: Stage 2 load-shedding implemented for Saturday The utility says this was due to vulnerability and low reliability of the system causing the loss of additional power generation units. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you This prevented Eskom from conserving diesel and water to stop or minimise load-shedding. Load-shedding started last Thursday and the risk for the rest of this week remains high. Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer spoke to Xoli Mngambi. #DStv403
