#DStv403 KWAZULU-NATAL - The search for a missing KwaZulu-Natal boy, who may have drowned, will resume on Tuesday. Nine-year-old Siyabonga Ndlovu was last seen playing in the uMvoti River on Saturday. There's a combination of anxiety and hope in the air as rescuers prepare for day three of their search.
The Ndlovu family have been waiting for any news about the little boy. Siyabonga's mother Nomkhosi Ndlovu recalls how she'd heard about what happened. READ: Search for missing child in uMvoti River continues "On my way from Stanger, I got a phone call saying I should rush back home. I came back and I was told Siyabonga was at uMvoti and has drowned. He was with his friends." Siyabonga isn't the first child to go missing in this area. IPSS Rescue's Paul Herbst says, "this year alone, according to our stats, it's between 13 and 15 kids that we've recovered this past year, that being from the floods, the most recent being in Tongaat, going all the way to Mtunzini." The community believes illegal sand mining is contributing to the number of drowning incidents. Residents want government to act against the companies responsible.
