PIETERMARITZBURG - The Limpopo Health Department is cancelling contracts of more than 150 community service doctors including some of those sent to Cuba to study. 450 nurses and other affiliated workers will also be laid off. This as the department faces dire financial constraints. Its alleged other provinces are also faced with similar issues. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said a number of posts are going to be made available for community service doctors and the Department is working on placing the qualified medical staff. "As far as we are concerned no doctors will be without permanent employment," he said. Mkhize said the financial situation in the province requires significant reprioritising to get what they need. The minister asked the employees and the public to bear with the Department while they make their deliberations.
