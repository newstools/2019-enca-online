File: eNCA’s Director of News Kanthan Pillay says his actions were irresponsible and unbecoming of a senior manager. JOHANNESBURG - eNCA’s Director of News Kanthan Pillay has apologised for an ill-advised tweet about political reporter Samkele Maseko’s resignation this week. The tweet implied that Maseko was a rat heading towards a sinking ship. A comprehensive internal probe is now underway. Pillay has issued a formal apology to Maseko, to all eNCA staff and the SABC. In that apology, Pillay calls his tweet irresponsible and ill-conceived and an action that was taken in haste and without thinking. Pillay says he has retracted the tweet in its entirety adding that his actions were irresponsible and unbecoming of a senior manager. Pillay’s actions are being thoroughly investigated by exco members of eNCA’s parent company e-Media Investments. Serious allegations have also been raised by Maseko about censorship at the station and in particular two recent stories. eNCA’s editor, Jeremy Maggs says the channel is not in the business of censoring stories but conversely, applies strict gatekeeping rules of fairness, impartiality and right of reply. Maggs says the concerns raised will be reviewed and if required an external and impartial adjudicator will be appointed. Maggs has also asked that due process be allowed to take place and says staff and viewers will be appraised of developments.
