eThekwini Infrastructure committee chairperson, Thanduxolo Sabelo, said divers had been sent to confirm the reservoir is cleared and they were able to definitively conclude it is. "We must state we test the water on a daily basis. We want to confirm and assure the residents that the water they are drinking currently from the compartment that was not affected is very clean. It's safe, they are able to drink it," Sabelo said. He also stated, "the other compartment has been drained and vacuumed and it will be reinstalled. We are expecting <it to operate> normally on Tuesday."
