He's commented for the first time in public about his health, following hospitalisation in Cuba. Zuma addressed dozens of Nkandla villagers who attended his annual Christmas party. "I heard some people saying he (Zuma) was spotted at the chess tournament but he is so weak that he couldn't even play. Why didn't you ask me how I feel? Why write something without asking me? What's wrong? Because I have all my strength. I'm perfectly fine."    
                  
Despite his mounting legal and financial woes, the former President's kept his promise to continue with his annual tradition of blessing vulnerable elders in his rural village.      
              
Zuma's assured village elders that as long as he is alive, this annual Christmas party will continue. READ: The white people who spied during apartheid "I committed myself to have this event. Only [lack of] resources can stop us but as long as we still have limited resources, we will continue. Even if it means we slaughter a goat and share, that alone will be lovely." In previous years, several political and business heavyweights were spotted at the event.
