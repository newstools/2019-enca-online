JOHANNESBURG - 10 years of defending the truth, and in that time the Daily Maverick has published more than 47,000 features. They've brought the world GuptaLeaks, the SARS Rogue Unit fake scandal, state capture, radical economic transformation, the VBS saga, and too many more to mention. A new book called We Have A Gamechanger lifts the lid on the efforts to keep the dream afloat. Daily Maverick publisher and CEO Styli Charalambous said the website ended up being a place where people can come to get the truth. "A lot of people thought we were crazy. They've been calling our time of death at any given stage for the last decade," he said. "The book kind of details the story of what it was like to keep this business going."
