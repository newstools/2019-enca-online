Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom's Kendal power station in Mpumalanga has been served with a notice to shut down two of its units by 9 January. Eskom's Environmental Manager Deidre Herbst says it hasn't met a number of emissions and environmental compliances. "Usually under normal circumstance, we would take a load loss on the plant and see if we can manage the ash with a load loss but in this situation, we had lost a lot of units on the system and Kendal was basically keeping the system stable but they didn't switch the Kendal units off, they carried on operating them and that caused significant damage especially to units five and six," Herbst said. "So Eskom then introduced the program to reduce the program and we have had certain successes and certain failures in reducing at the plant but since June this year we have a significant reduction in the emissions but we still haven't managed to comply with the 100 mg limit that we are required to comply with. “We have given plans to the authorities on what we had planned to do, we've met some of those plans but not all of them and I think authorities have gotten to the point where they have decided they needed to issue a compliance notice because we weren't making the satisfactory progress on the emission reductions.” Energy Analyst Chris Yelland says this could impact energy supply and load-shedding in the country.
