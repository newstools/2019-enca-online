Da Gama said councillors were confused about what constitutes a majority in the election of a new mayor, and also what happens when there's a three-way contest. A simple majority win has been advised by a private law firm. Premier David Makhura and Gauteng Urban Planning MEC Lebogang Maile, in a scathing letter to the speaker, said that if the council fails to elect a new mayor, the provincial government will step in.

"We are saying to the Speaker that he must convene a meeting of all the whips and the rules committee in council to present the legal advice that he has sought and there must be convergence and consensus before the council meeting." 
Da Gama's response is that the MEC doesn't seem to accept that local government has its own autonomy.
