File: Following a night of darkness, South Africa wakes up to more load-shedding as  Stage 2 continues until 11pm. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom continues with rolling blackouts until 11pm. The embattled power utility has been struggling to keep the lights on since Thursday afternoon. On Friday, the utility escalated its load-shedding from Stage 2 to Stage 4 and from 11pm Friday night it shifted back to Stage 2. Increased electricity demand and capacity challenges are being blamed.

"We are beginning to experience coal-handling problems at a number of our power stations as a result of wet coal," said the statement. "If the weather persists, we are likely to implement load-shedding through the weekend." Rolling blackouts in February and March plunged businesses, homes and schools into darkness for hours on end.
