Nkosi Johnson's memory lives on through his mother, Gail Johnson, who runs Nkosi's Haven. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Nkosi's Haven founder, Gail Johnson says while the country has made many strides in fighting HIV and Aids, the youth still face many social challenges. Gail was the adoptive mother of Nkosi Johnson, the boy who impacted many by pushing the boundaries of public perceptions of HIV/Aids. He was 12-years-old when he died in 2001, and at the time was the longest-surviving child born HIV-positive. "So much work, energy, and research was put into the prevention of mother to child transmission and it is those children that were saved that are now falling pregnant and testing positive," said Johnson. "They were saved, they don't know what went into saving them, there is a gap somewhere and whose responsibility is it to educate those children that were saved not to take unnecessary risks."
