WATCH: R4 rifles stolen from SANDF military base At least nineteen rifles were stolen from the Lyttelton military base in Pretoria. There is a strong suspicion that the crime was an inside job. South African National Defence Force (SANDF) spokesperson, Siphiwe Dlamini says the culprits know the ins and outs of the base. "It shouldn't be possible. It is a matter of who is involved in this thing. The area where the rifles were stolen from was highly secured." READ: SANDF used to fight Cape Town's gangs. Why it's a bad idea Dlamini says the thieves would have to be knowledgable of the geography of the area. The ANC has welcomed the SANDF investigation and the apprehension of suspects. Criminals have walked away with at least nineteen R4 rifles after a break-in at the Lyttleton military base in Pretoria.Courtesy #DStv403
