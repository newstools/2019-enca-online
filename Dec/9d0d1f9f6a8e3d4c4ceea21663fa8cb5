This follows outrage and condemnation after a tweet he posted. The tweet does not represent the views of e-Media Investments and the channel. After intense overnight investigation and consultation, the channel decided it had no alternative but to end its relationship with him. Although he was acting in an individual capacity and his posting was unsolicited, he was nonetheless a senior member of staff and the channel believes there was no room for any other outcome and that damage control was imperative. Serious allegations have also been levelled at eNCA about Pillay’s censorship of stories and his management style. The channel takes the allegations of censorship very seriously. READ: eNCA’s Kanthan Pillay apologises for tweet To that end, eNCA is co-operating fully with the SA National Editors Forum that has requested clarity. The channel will be appointing an external expert to investigate these claims. Editor-in-Chief Jeremy Maggs says: “All news organisations have one currency and that is credibility. It is clear this negative attention has adversely affected eNCA’s reputation and credibility. "However, with the talented and dedicated staff we have, I believe the channel can recover. Right now our immediate priorities are to mend strained relationships and to rebuild credibility with its audience and other stakeholders as soon as possible.”
