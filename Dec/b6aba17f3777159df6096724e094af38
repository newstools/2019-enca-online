File: Battered conglomerate Steinhoff to face legal action from the Public Investment Corporation. CAPE TOWN - The PIC wants to force Steinhoff's hand. It's preparing to file legal papers against Steinhoff to make it release a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that could shed light on what went wrong at the retail giant. The Government Employees Pension Fund is PIC’s biggest client and the Steinhoff losses directly affected billions of rand in pensioners’ money.
