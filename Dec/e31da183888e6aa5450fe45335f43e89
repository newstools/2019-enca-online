File: George Russell outqualified departing team mate Robert Kubica 21-0 this season but finished last overall. ABU DHABI - George Russell, the only Formula One driver without a point this year, swapped his tail-end Williams for a title-winning Mercedes and ended up fastest on the final day of post-season testing in Abu Dhabi. The Mercedes-backed rookie did 145 laps of the Yas Marina circuit, the second most of the day, with a fastest lap of one minute 37.204 seconds -- more than three seconds quicker than his time for Williams. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc crashed, bringing out red flags, but was second fastest. Russell outqualified departing team mate Robert Kubica 21-0 this season but finished last overall after the Pole managed to score a point in Germany -- the former champions' only top-10 finish of the campaign. This was his second stint for Mercedes this season, with the highly-rated 21-year-old testing in Bahrain last April. "It's been a pleasure driving the championship-winning W10 today. We tested the 2020 tyres and I've learned a huge amount about them which I'm sure will help both myself and the team going into next season," said Russell. Canadian Lance Stroll was third fastest for Racing Point.
