Graffiti is many things - a medium for social change, of protest or simply a community expressing itself. What started out as four young people beautifying the walls of Langa with graffiti later inspired them to open their own art gallery. The 16 on Lerotholi is the first of its kind in the community. “The aim was to tell a story, a unique story about Langa trying to convert Langa into an art destination. So the first artist we are working with from Langa is Mongezi Gum,” said co-founder of the gallery, Thulani Fesi. The founders want to exhibit work by other young Langa artists and are hoping to draw them to the gallery.

Less than a week old, the gallery has not only created a buzz locally, it has managed to gain the attention of tourists.
