WATCH: McBride vying for Deputy Public Protector position The DA's Glynnis Breytenbach says although Gcaleka meets the criteria she is not the right person for the job. "She (Gcaleka) was a vociferous supporter of Menzi Simelane who can only be described as a wrecking-ball during his tenure at the NPA. She actively assisted Simelane in destroying the NPA. Miss Gcaleka is not a good fit for this job." The National Freedom Party (NFP) is supporting Gcaleka's nomination. NFP says she needs to be given an opportunity to serve.
