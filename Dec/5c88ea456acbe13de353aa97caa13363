South Africans have been hit by load-shedding once again. But there are some of the fun things to do when there are power outages. JOHANNESBURG - Brace yourself for further power cuts.Stage 2 load-shedding will come into effect at 9am and is expected to last until 11pm. The power utility is blaming wet coal and increased demand for the rolling blackouts. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you "Load-shedding is required to cater for further trips and to create capacity to replenish water reserves for our pumped storage schemes," Eskom said in a statement. "Sufficient water and diesel reserves are necessary to limit the level of load-shedding in the coming week." The utility will cut up to 2,000 megawatts (MW) of power from the national grid on a rotational basis. READ: Stage 2 load-shedding implemented for Saturday This means you will be scheduled for load-shedding six times over a four-day period for two hours at a time, or six times over an eight-day period for four hours at a time. Rolling blackouts in February and March plunged businesses, homes and schools into darkness for hours on end. Load-shedding resumed again in October, when the government unveiled plans to restructure the company and orient it towards more renewable sources of energy. - Additional reporting AFP
