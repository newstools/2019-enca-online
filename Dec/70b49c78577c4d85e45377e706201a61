Debt Rescue is predicting another bleak year for the economy. JOHANNESBURG - Janu-worry or not, South Africans are drowning in debt. The country's economy continues to shrink while the cost of living continues to rise. Debt Rescue is predicting another bleak year for the economy. "We've seen a lot of petrol price increases, interest rates during the past couple of years and the reality is all these costs filter down to the price of goods and services," said Debt Rescue CEO Neil Roets.

Roets said the country's middle class is getting poorer. Increased taxes and the inability to keep up with inflation and price increases are hitting them hard. He said it's unfair that the middle class is being forced to carry the economy.

They're paying a lot of taxes but they're not getting a lot of tax breaks. "They're earning more than the lower-income people but not enough to cover all these price increases, so they're in a very difficult situation."
