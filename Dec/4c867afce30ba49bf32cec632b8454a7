JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula wants those caught speeding to be denied bail. So far this festive season, there’s been a 30 percent decline in road deaths compared to last year. Mbalula says he intends to ensure that traffic officials maintain a high visibility on the roads, conduct stop-and-searches and random alcohol testing. "We are going to [use] guerilla tactics: working on those who break the law, including policing police officers who basically take bribes. That is going to intensify for the reminder, up until we release the statistics on the 23rd of January." READ: Traffic authorities determined to reduce road deaths The transport minister says the plan is to continue with this action throughout 2020 and have traffic officers on the roads 24/7. "The law must bite. It cannot be business as usual. "Drink and driving: it's a mess, it causes carnage. I intend to come down heavy going forward in terms of the law - I want people in jail for drink and driving. I want them to be locked up because when you leave your house, your area of entertainment drunk behind the wheel you'll cause accidents, death on the roads, including to yourself. I'm saving yourself from yourself through the law," he said.
