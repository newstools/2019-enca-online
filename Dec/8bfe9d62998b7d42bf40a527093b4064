ALBERTON - Transnet says the pipeline on fire in Alberton was being decommissioned when it was tampered with. Firefighters spotted a large fire on Tuesday morning and evacuated residents from nearby homes. Saret Knoetze, Transnet spokesperson said the fire originated from an inoperational section of the petrol pipeline that was tampered with. The parallel-running jet fuel pipeline was not affected by the blaze. She explained while the petrol pipeline was decommissioned and inoperational, there was some petrol still inside which fueled the fire Knoetze said the cause of the fire was due to tampering, probably because of attempted theft.
