Immediately when the chief of police saw this video she instructed the head of internal investigation to immediately commence with investigations,” said Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson, Isaac Mahamba. The Tshwane Metro Police Department has received statements from three of the police officers involved, as well as the victim. The Institute of Security Studies' Gareth Newman says police are properly trained, but they still often don't adhere to the laws they're meant to uphold. “When police officers act like this, it’s critically important that appropriate action is taken to ensure that that behaviour is stopped and start acting like professionals that they should be,” said Newman.
