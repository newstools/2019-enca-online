According to the self-proclaimed leader of the refugees, Jean-Pierre Balous he recruited a man called Papi Sukami to communicate with Lingala speaking people within the group as his first language is Swahili. Balous claimed Sukami and a small group of men, calling themselves "the former soldiers of Zaire" tried to wrest control from him and attacked his supporters with pangas and other weapons.

Sukami and his supporters were left to sleep outside the church on Sunday. The group led by Papi Sukami have said Balous has been fundraising on behalf of the group of refugees but selectively distributing that aid. They also claim he has refused help from charity groups such as the Gift of the Givers and the Red Cross Society. Food was brought to the group outside the church. A scuffle over the food reportedly prompted police to fire stun grenades, to disperse the crowds.
