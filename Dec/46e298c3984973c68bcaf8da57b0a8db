Douglas Ryder reacts to an incident in which Nic Dlamini's arm was broken during an assaulted by park rangers in Cape Town. JOHANNESBURG - Cyclist Nic Dlamini, who suffered a broken arm during an altercation with SanParks rangers,Â dreams of competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Dlamini was riding in the Silvermine section of Table Mountain National Park on Friday when he was stopped by rangers. SanParks says it would appear that Dlamini failed to get a permit to enter the park. Video footage of the incident show rangers pushing Dlamini around, before his arm is broken. NTT Pro Cycling Manager Douglas Ryder has condemned the incident, saying Dlamini had a good season this year and was hoping to be selected for Team South Africa at the Olympics. "This could be something that hampers his 2020 season which will ultimately affect his career and that's incredibly terrible in terms of his personal career." The Environment Minister has instructed SanParks to suspend all officials involved in the incident while the matter is investigated.
