D'Arcy Short was added to the Australian squad. MELBOURNE - D'Arcy Short was added to the Australian squad for their upcoming one-day tour of India, with allrounder Sean Abbott sidelined for up to a month with a side strain. The three-match tour gets underway on January 14 in Mumbai and National Selector Trevor Hohns said allrounder Short deserved his chance. "D'Arcy offers the squad another spinning all-rounder option along with Ashton Agar, which along with the four world-class fast bowlers and Adam Zampa balances the squad out nicely," he said. "His proven record and ability to bat anywhere in the order will also be a great asset to the squad." Abbott, who had been selected after five years in the one-day international wilderness, picked up the injury playing for the Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League on Friday.
