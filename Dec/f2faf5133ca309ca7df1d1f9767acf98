GENEVA - The United Nations said it was procuring food assistance for 4.1 million Zimbabweans, a quarter of the population in a country where shortages are being exacerbated by runaway inflation and climate-induced drought. Zimbabwe, once the breadbasket of southern Africa, is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by soaring inflation and shortages of food, fuel, medicines and electricity. "We are very much concerned as the situation continues to deteriorate," Eddie Rowe, World Food Programme (WFP) country director, speaking from Harare, told a Geneva news briefing.

Zimbabwe has only had one year of normal rainfall in the last five and "markets are not functioning", he said. "There are families that go to bed hungry without a meal a day," Rowe added. Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government will scrap its plan to remove grain subsidies next year, a move it says will protect impoverished citizens from rising food prices, state media reported last week.
