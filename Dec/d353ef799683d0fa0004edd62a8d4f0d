File: Two Johannesburg doctors face arrest in connection with a child's death. JOHANNESBURG - Warrants of arrest have been issued for a well-known Johannesburg paediatric surgeon and an anaesthetist. It follows the death of 10-year-old Zayyaan Sayed at Parklane Clinic earlier this year following a routine procedure. The doctors were suspended from practicing at Netcare and MediClinic hospitals pending an investigation into the matter. In November, eNCA spoke to a number of parents who had complaints against the surgeon in relation to his conduct when operating on children.
