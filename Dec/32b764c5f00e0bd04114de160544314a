Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula says fewer deaths have been recorded in all provinces. Gauteng has recorded a decrease in deaths from last year’s 133 to 95. To keep the toll low, Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo says all roadworthy vehicles must be taken off the roads. READ: Almost 600 deaths on SA roads this festive season “Motorists must be very careful because we are going to remove them and we are prepared to test the law to the highest level possible to make sure that cars that are not supposed to be on the road are not on the road.” Mamabolo says a lack of facilities to keep the impounded vehicles at had been a headache for authorities. He’s now opened seven depots around Gauteng to encourage the impounding of dodgy vehicles. “To that extent, we have issued a public notice in which we were declaring seven sites of impounding of vehicles that do not comply with the laws,” he added. Mamabolo also attributes their success to good behaviour by motorists. He’s called on them to continue adhering to the rules of the road.
