Honoree Mariah Carey performs onstage during the 2019 Billboard Music Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 01, 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada. NEW YORK - A quarter-century after releasing her holiday classic that's become one of the season's love-to-hate, hate-to-love cliches, Mariah Carey has finally pushed "All I Want for Christmas Is You" to top the charts for the first time. "We did it," the diva said Monday in a tweet that featured several emojis, including a face with happy tears. COMING SOON 🎥🎅🏽🎄 A post shared by  Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Dec 12, 2019 at 10:11am PST Many social media users voiced shock that the inescapable pop juggernaut had not already jingled its way to the top. The earworm that showcases the pop mainstay's elastic vocal range started appearing the list annually beginning in 2012, when streams were added to Billboard's ranking metrics. WATCH: 'All I want for Christmas' highest charting holiday hit For the song's 25th anniversary this year, Carey promoted it even harder than usual, beginning her social media drive the morning after Halloween. She also dropped a new video for it -- which counts towards Hot 100 placement -- and released the song as a stand-alone CD single for the first time. This week the song posted 45 million streams, 27,000 digital sales and 34 million radio plays, according to Billboard. Carey's climb to the top marks the first time a Christmas track has claimed number one on the Hot 100 in six decades, when "The Chipmunk Song" reigned for four weeks in 1958-1959.
