And experts warn that dry spells are likely to become longer. READ: South Africans warned to brace for sweltering heat “We have to be concerned. We’re having a growing population, and years and years of drought, we have to be in the culture of saving water. It shouldn’t only be when we have extreme events like heatwaves,” said SA Weather Service senior forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng. While Gauteng is baking, other parts of the country are even hotter. This week the mercury in Beaufort West, Upington and Laingsburg went over 42 degrees, Augrabies Falls was at over 46 degrees and Noupoort a whopping 47. But the hottest town in South Africa is Vioolsdrif, near the Namibian border. Weather forecast for 1 December 2019
