Everybody might want a Lassie, Rocky or Snowy, but maybe giving a pet as a Christmas gift might not be the best idea. JOHANNESBURG - If you're going to gift a pet this Christmas, don't. Unless you are sure thatÂ the person will be committed to it for life.
That's the advice from pet rescue shelters that see many puppies grow into big dogs behind cages. "The problem with this time of the year is that most shelters are so full that we just can't accommodate the high numbers of the unwanted," said Fora shelter manager Linda Scrace. Having received about 40 dogs this December alone, Scrace says people need to learn to treat their pets like family.
"It's like having a child. You know, you don't trade your child in when you see a cuter child and go uh I want this one let me drop this one at the orphanage. "You are committed to them so you need to become a responsible animal owner."
