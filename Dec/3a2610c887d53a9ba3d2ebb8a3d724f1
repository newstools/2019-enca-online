Tesla CEO Elon Musk has won his defamation case. LOS ANGELES - Tesla co-founder Elon Musk was cleared of defamation on Friday by a jury in Los Angeles over a tweet in which he labelled a British caver "pedo guy." The jury deliberated less than an hour before ruling in favour of Musk and clearing him of any liability in the high-profile case that pitted him against Vernon Unsworth. Unsworth had sought $190-million in damages from the tech billionaire, arguing that his reputation had been damaged by the tweet. Musk hugged his lawyer on hearing the verdict, telling reporters afterwards: "My faith in humanity has been restored."

"I just hope that nobody else has to go through (this) and go toe-to-toe with Mr Musk again," Stephens said, noting the "enormous" amount of money Musk had at his disposal to defend himself. Unsworth said he was sorry the verdict did not go his way but would respect the jury's decision. The caver's legal team had told jurors in closing arguments that the $190-million he was seeking would amount to "a hard slap on the wrist" for Musk and would prevent him "from ever planting a nuclear bomb in the life of another individual."

Musk's outburst against Unsworth followed an interview in which the 64-year-old caver dismissed Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to rescue young soccer players trapped in a cave in Thailand in the summer of 2018.
