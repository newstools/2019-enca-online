PRETORIA - The high court in Pretoria has granted the DA an urgent interdict against the ousting of mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and speaker Katlego Mathebe. The ANC argued the party should deal with political problems in a political forum, rather than running to court.

The DA's argument remains the same: That the resolutions of the special council meeting should be nullified because proper processes weren't followed.

Tshwane residents will know in about a week if they'll have a new mayor come the new year.
