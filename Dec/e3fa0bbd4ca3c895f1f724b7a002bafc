"Virtual boyfriend" Zhuansun Xu talking to a girlfriend on his phone. Zhuansun is a foreign exchange trader in the day, and by night he chats with female clients who pay him to be their "boyfriend". BEIJING - Chinese teen Robin spends hours online chatting to her man, who always has a sympathetic ear for her problems -- as long as she's willing to pay him. The 19-year-old pre-medical student has spent more than 1,000 yuan ($150) speaking to "virtual boyfriends". These aren't seedy sex-chat lines but men who charge for friendly and flirty online communication, from wake-up calls to lengthy text exchanges and video conversations. The option for intimacy on-demand has gained popularity among China's middle-income young women, who are often focused on careers with no immediate plans to marry and start a family. Shops selling virtual friends and partners can be found on Chinese messaging app WeChat or on an e-commerce site like Taobao. Several virtual boyfriends told AFP that most of their customers are single women in their twenties with disposable income. Prices start from a few yuan for half an hour of texting, to a few thousand yuan to keep a companion on retainer for phone calls throughout a month. Pursuing romance had not been available to many Chinese women in the past. China's marriage rate -- the number of marriages per year -- has been in decline over the last five years. Last year it reached 7.2 per 1,000 people, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
