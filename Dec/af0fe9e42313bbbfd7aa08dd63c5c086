Gamers from the Vietnam team compete in the qualifying rounds of the eSports event between Malaysia and Vietnam at the SEA Games (Southeast Asian Games) in Manila. MANILA -Â eSports took a step into the sporting mainstream as it made its debut at the Southeast Asian Games, becoming a medal event for the first time at an Olympic-recognised multi-sport competition. As the typhoon-hit Games, spread across dozens of venues in the northern Philippines, neared the halfway stage, eSports made its grand entrance at a darkened arena in Manila. It represents progress for video gaming, which was a demonstration sport at last year's Asian Games but has been left off the programme for the next edition in 2022. Players from nine countries are competing over six days for medals in Mobile Legends, Arena of Valor, Dota 2, Starcraft II, Tekken 7 and Hearthstone. "This is a very, very historic day because for the first time eSports will be played in the Southeast Asian Games," local mayor Francis Zamora said at an opening ceremony at the 5,500-capacity San Juan Arena.
