An India national flag is seen as India's cricket captain Virat Kohli takes part in a training session at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on December 21, 2019, ahead of the third one day international (ODI) cricket match of a three-match series between India and West Indies. INDIA - India skipper Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bowl in the third and deciding one-day international against West Indies in Cuttack on Sunday. The hosts have made one change with debutant paceman Navdeep Saini coming in for Deepak Chahar who injured his back in the team's series-levelling win on Wednesday. "We played against England at a similar time here (in Cuttack) and defending 380 was a challenge," Kohli said at the toss. "Toss gives you an advantage, yes, but that doesn't mean we'll still win if we play reckless cricket. It's also good to see how we've responded when we've lost tosses too." West Indies, led by Kieron Pollard, are unchanged despite losing their previous ODI by 107 runs in Visakhapatnam.

"I'm not exactly sure about how the pitch would behave. It's a matter of assessing the pitch and playing good cricket," said Pollard. "Hopefully, the openers will set up a good platform for the others to take it forward."
