Forty years after his death, his legacy lives on. Many who knew him, say Kies would have been critical of South Africa today. A memorial event has been held in Cape Town to honour his life. High Court Judge Siraj Desai remembers Kies as being one of the sharpest minds he'd ever known.
"He was an outstanding intellect, as a lawyer he was outstanding, as a political analyst he was outstanding and just to be with him was a great privilege. "One rarely encounters a person of that ability," said Desai.
Desai believes Kies would have criticised South Africa's current state.
"He'd be starkly critical of certainly the economic development of lack of development in this country. "He'd have been starkly critical of the inequity that persists in this country."
Desai says Kies would have also been appalled at the racism that's still prevalent.
