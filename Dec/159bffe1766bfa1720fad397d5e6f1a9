JOHANNESBURG - The AbaThembu King's brother, Prince Zanothando Dalindyebo, said a few processes still need to be discussed before a decision is made on whether the King will resume his duties. King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo was released from prison on Monday. "You must remember that he has been released on parole, so that has conditions that we need to follow and based on that we need to have consultations with various stakeholders, including the government." READ: AbaThembu King Dalindyebo released from prison "On the 9th of January 2020, we will be [going] to the royal palace so as to find a new mandate and give clarity to Abathembu', said Zanothando. He was convicted in 2013 for crimes including arson, culpable homicide, kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The remission is for 12 months, which means that Dalindyebo has had one year removed from his sentence. The AbaThembu Royal family has welcomed the move. Courtesy #DStv403
