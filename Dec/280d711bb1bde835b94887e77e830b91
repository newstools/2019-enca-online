ADELAIDE - In South Australia, a very thirsty Koala flagged down a group of cyclists and guzzled all their water. Australia is in the grips of a massive heatwave with parts of the south recording temperatures of above 40 degrees Celsius.

That was before he spotted the water and proceeded to drink heartily for a couple of minutes. Bikebug2019 on Instagram posted photos of the incident, saying "Australian Koala Bears suffering severe thirst in a heatwave. This Koala just walked right up to me as I was descending and climbed up onto my bike while I gave him water. BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO ME ON A RIDE EVER."
