Nic Dlamini is in hospital after being manhandled by park rangers at Silvermine Nature Reserve in Cape Town. In a video filmed by another cyclist, rangers are seen pushing Dlamini up against their vehicle while demanding a permit from him to cycle in the reserve. Dlamini is heard complaining that they are injuring his arm before he is forced into the back of the bakkie. SanParks spokesman Reynold Thakhuli says rangers were alerted after Dlamini entered the park without paying. "According to them [the rangers, Dlamini] was quite aggressive - he was requested to produce the necessary documentation which is the entry permit or an activity permit that usually cyclists are paying for a period of time, and he couldn't produce that and he couldn't co-operate. As they were trying to arrest him, he resisted arrest and as the thing ensued unfortunately he suffered a broken arm." Thakhuli says an investigation will be conducted to establish exactly what happened. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says action will be taken against those in the wrong. "The relationship between SanParks and the cycling community is not a good one and ... we need to make sure that we sit around a table and develop a relationship."
