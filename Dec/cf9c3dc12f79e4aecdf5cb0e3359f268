Eskom's Generations Stations Capacity screen monitors each power station and unit for electricity production. JOHANNESBURG - No load-shedding is planned for Saturday. But Eskom warns the grid remains constrained and vulnerable. While several units have returned to service the utility unexpectedly lost some units last night. WATCH: Cabinet briefing on Eskom It says it will continue to use emergency services to supplement capacity where necessary. “Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation, carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the possibility of load-shedding,” Eskom said in a statement.
