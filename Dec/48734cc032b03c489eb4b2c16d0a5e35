An employee for Japanese cosmetics company Kao removes a super thin transparent layer after using a palm-sized diffuser on her face. TOKYO -Â A Japanese cosmetics company unveiled what it said was the world's first spray-on skin, a moisturising facemask made of fibres one-100th the thickness of a human hair. After applying an absorbent lotion, users spray the fibres onto their face and a thin translucent sheet is quickly formed, acting as a "greenhouse" for the real skin below to soak up the moisture and still be able to breathe. The "second skin" can be worn overnight or peeled off after about a minute. "This is the world's first cosmetic product using such technology," according to Masayuki Uchiyama, skincare researcher at Kao, the firm behind the innovation. The hand-held diffuser was 10 years in the making, said Uchiyama, who admitted: "We struggled to make the device small." Kao researchers did not initially think of using the technology of ultra-thin fibres to create a layer on the skin, he said, adding that the precise material from which they were made was a secret. "But we learned that the skin can still breathe under the thin fibres for many hours" in an environment akin to a greenhouse. Such cutting-edge tech does not come cheap though, with each diffuser costing 50,000 yen ($460). Nevertheless, Kao predicts cosmetic sales could reach 100 billion yen if the technology is applied to the medical field.
