Ian Foster was the preferred candidate of illustrious departing coach Steve Hansen. WELLINGTON - Former assistant Ian Foster was named as the All Blacks' new head coach on Wednesday as the three-time World Cup winners opted for continuity despite a disappointing semi-final exit at the latest edition in Japan. Foster was the preferred candidate of illustrious departing coach Steve Hansen, under whom he worked for eight years, and was always the favourite to take over and rebuild the side. He beat main rival Scott Robertson to the job, despite the Crusaders mentor winning three straight Super Rugby titles, with New Zealand Rugby saying Foster offered "fresh energy". "He brings world-class international experience to the role, an incredibly strong coaching team, and we think he'll do an outstanding job," chairman Brent Impey said in a statement. Foster, who has signed a two-year contract -- which stops short of the 2023 World Cup in France -- said he was humbled to take over one of the most coveted roles in rugby. "I feel truly privileged and honoured to be given this opportunity and I can't wait to lead the team into the next chapter of what is a remarkable legacy," he said. Despite working under Hansen during a period of outstanding All Blacks success, including winning the 2015 World Cup, Foster will be a controversial choice for some Kiwi rugby fans. Critics point to an uninspiring eight-year spell in charge of the Waikato Chiefs, when their best result was a losing appearance in the 2009 final. NZR are gambling that he can maintain the success achieved under Hansen and repeat the smooth transition his predecessor made from assistant to head coach. However, the fact that his contract does not run until the next World Cup may be a sign that NZR chiefs are hedging their bets.
