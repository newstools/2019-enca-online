Fitch, which already has South Africa’s creditworthiness in sub-investment grade, has kept its rating steady with a negative outlook. JOHANNESBURG - Fitch, which already has South Africa in sub-investment grade, has kept its rating steady with a negative outlook. The rand reached a four-month best against the dollar on Thursday after the announcement. While Fitch junked South Africa’s credit rating some time ago, the decision to hold off pushing it further into sub-investment grade was welcome news.
The agency said that South Africa’s ratings are constrained by low growth potential, high and rising government debt, large contingent liabilities as well as the risk of rising social tensions due to extremely high inequality.

The rating was held at BB+ or one notch below junk level, with a negative outlook.
It warned that a downgrade could be triggered if the South African government cannot get a hold in its debt.
National Treasury acknowledged the firm’s position, saying that it “remains committed to the stabilisation and improvement of its fiscal position”.

Further, government will continue to work hand-in-hand with unions to manage the growth of the public sector wage bill in order to reduce government’s debt burden.
“Government is also cognisant of the pressures and risks that state owned companies, particularly Eskom, present to the fiscal framework. Government is providing medium- term support to Eskom to secure energy supply and to honour the state’s contractual obligations,” it said.
