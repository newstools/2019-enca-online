"Jumanji: The Next Level" iced out "Frozen II" at the North American box office this weekend. LOS ANGELES -Â "Jumanji: The Next Level" iced out "Frozen II" at the North American box office this weekend, raking in $59.3-million on its debut, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said. Sony's latest "Jumanji" sequel stars Jack Black, Dwayne ("The Rock") Johnson and Kevin Hart as a group of friends once more sucked into a dangerous video game world. Disney's "Frozen II" -- a return to Arendelle and the magical animated world of Queen Elsa, sister Anna and the gang -- took in $19.1-million for the Friday-to-Sunday period. In third place was Lionsgate's droll murder mystery "Knives Out," at $9.1-million. Daniel Craig stars as a Southern detective hired by an anonymous client to unravel the bloody death of a wealthy patriarch.

The film sparked controversy by suggesting that a now-dead female journalist traded sex for inside information. At $4.7-million, it was one of the poorest openings ever for a Clint Eastwood movie. In fifth was Universal's new slasher film "Black Christmas," which appropriately opened on Friday the 13th, with a $4.2-million take that nearly recouped the film's $5-million cost. It features a group of sorority sisters stranded on a deserted campus over the holidays -- naturally, fending off a killer.
