Burna Boy poses for a portrait during the BET Awards 2019 at Microsoft Theater on June 23, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. JOHANNESBURG - Nigerian musician Burna Boy will no longer be performing at the Afropunk music festival in Johannesburg. Afropunk organisers made the announcement on Twitter. "Hey SA fam: After a joint discussion with Burna Boy’s team, we are announcing that he will no longer be part of Joburg’s 2019 lineup. We’ve agreed that now isn’t the right time for him to come', read the caption on Twitter. In November, South African artists united against having the Ye hitmaker perform at the Africans Unite concert after he said he would boycott the country because his fellow Nigerians were being treated badly. The concert was then cancelled following backlash and reports of a planned shutdown.
