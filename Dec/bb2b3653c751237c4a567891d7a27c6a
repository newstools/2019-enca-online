Miss Universe 2019 Zozibini Tunzi sat down with comedian and Daily Show host Trevor Noah. JOHANNESBURG - Zozibini Tunzi recently made an appearance on The Daily Show in the US. The newly-crowned Miss Universe spoke to fellow South African Trevor Noah about her journey to Miss South Africa and Miss Universe. "It has been interesting since I won Miss South Africa and finding out that I would be doing Miss Universe as well, it was incredible the support that I got from back home but it was challenging as well because I had a new look that people were not used to. WATCH: I'm not going to change my hair, says Zozibini Tunzi "So I got crowned and I got a lot of different responses, but I was quite excited about it regardless of what was happening," said Tunzi. The beauty recalled nasty comments on social media, with one user calling her 'Miss Ugly SA'. "I got comments like, she is a downgrade from the others that we have had and this was only from people in my country. "Then it got more international as people found out that I was going to do Miss Universe and then international people started commenting," she added. Tunzi also spoke out against the scourge of gender-based violence in South Africa.
