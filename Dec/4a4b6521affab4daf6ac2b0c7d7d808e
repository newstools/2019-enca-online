JOHANNESBURG - South African Cricketers’ Association (SACA) is calling for the resignation of the chief executive and the entire board of Cricket South Africa (CSA).

READ: Standard Bank won't renew Proteas sponsorship deal ”It is abundantly clear that there is no confidence, from any quarter amongst cricket stakeholders, in the CSA Board.  No one on the Board can say that he, or she, was unaware of what has been unfolding over at least the last year.  It has all been happening, in many respects even publically, under the Board’s very nose, and in some instances with Board support.” The association didn't rule out a possibility of industrial action should their concerns not be addressed. Saca held a combined meeting of its Players Executive Committee and its Management Board in Cape Town on Friday. Meanwhile, Standard Bank informed CSA that it will not renew its agreement as the title sponsor of the South African National Men’s Cricket Team. The bank cites recent development at CSA as the reason for its decision. The current contract comes to an end on 30 April 2020. READ: Calls for CSA CEO to step down Standard Bank says it is immensely proud of the many milestones reached as the title sponsor. Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Thulani Sibeko, said in a statement, the decision not to renew the sponsorship agreement was not taken lightly. “Standard Bank is committed to upholding the highest levels of leadership, integrity and governance. In light of recent developments at CSA, which are a culmination of long-standing problems which have damaged Standard Bank’s reputation, it has decided not to renew its partnership with CSA."
