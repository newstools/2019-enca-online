National Union of Mineworkers' representatives said the president was incorrectly informed when he said elements of sabotage were involved in Eskom's need for load-shedding. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa's claims of sabotage at the Tutuka Power Station is being widely questioned. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) believes the president is being misled. Ramaphosa says sabotage saw Eskom losing 2,000 megawatts leading to stage 6 load-shedding. “Whatever the president has said yesterday, it is nothing but misinformation that was given to him, hence he ends up misleading the country and we sympathise with the president because he was misled.” READ: What is Stage 6 load-shedding? Motubatse said for the sabotaged to have happened as claimed by Ramaphosa, three units needed to have been sabotaged. An employee at the Tutuka told eNCA that there were unaware of the sabotage. “As an employee of Tutuka Power Station, we are not aware of any sabotage that has been reported by the president and management has never communicated to us any sabotage that is in the station.” - Load-shedding could be avoided - Motubatse said three power stations were currently being shut down.

If ever those units can be brought to the grid, we will not be having load-shedding.” “They must just bring back those units and we'll have enough capacity,” he said.
