JOHANNESBURG - The first thing that Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe did when he got home in the early hours of this morning was head to the kitchen. Cekeshe was released from Leeuwkop prison in terms of President Cyril Ramaphosa's "remission of sentences". He was sentenced to eight years, with three years suspended for his involvement in the university protest action. Cekeshe's lawyer Wikus Steyl says the activist missed his mother's food. "The first thing he did when he got home was go straight through to the kitchen and asked mom to make him breakfast. He said he never wants to eat prison food in his life again."

"We remain firmly of the belief that Kanya should never have been found guilty and he should definitely have not received an eight year sentence. Our petitions are based on the very bad legal advice [Cekeshe received] and on the magistrate simply not following the criminal procedure act. "I spoke to Kanya early this morning and I assured him that we will continue the fight to have his name cleared - his conviction will affect the rest of his life so we really need to clear his name. The legal system shafted him so we must continue the fight," he said.
