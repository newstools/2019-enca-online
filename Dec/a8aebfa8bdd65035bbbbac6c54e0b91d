Thousands of delegates have started flocking in. And the country’s third-biggest party will vote for its new leadership at the weekend. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters says it has spent just more than R32-million for its second national peoples’ assembly. The party will hold its elective conference this weekend in Nasrec to choose new leaders and iron out party policies. A subtle leadership contest is also brewing but not for EFF leader Julius Malema’s position. After scandals of money, looting of VBS Bank, new trust funds and family relatives running companies linked to looting, funding Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu the party says it cost millions of rands to organize this conference. “At last count, we haven’t done the final tally of how much for the NPA (National People’s Assembly), but last count was around R32-million and transport is a very expensive thing and venue. Yes we have given VIP treatment and no VBS money was used,” said EFF Treasurer General Leigh-Ann Mathys. WATCH: In conversation with Julius Malema The EFF is painting Johannesburg red as they go to their second National People’s Assembly. Malema is expected to come back as the Commander-In-Chief of the red berets and Shivambu retaining the deputy presidency but other top four positions are up for grabs. Godrich Gardee will exit as secretary-general. “The issue of leadership is going to be responded to when delegates have nominated whoever they nominate for leadership in plenary,” Shivambu said. “So we are going to respond to that question in plenary. It will be a thorough process which we will be engaged in tomorrow.” Marshall Dlamini is tipped to take over as secretary-general of the party. Mathys (treasurer-general), Advocate Dali Mpofu (national chairperson) and Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi (deputy secretary-general) are set to make an exit.
