PLETTENBERG BAY - Plettenberg Bay will be lit up by lasers at midnight on Tuesday instead of fireworks in a bid to ensure fire safety and the welfare of pets and other animals. READ: New firework by-laws for City of Johannesburg Bitou municipality spokesperson Andile Namntu said the decision to limit the display to lasers was made on 7 December after the intervention of animal rights activists and in consideration of the fire risks. There will be a beach laser display at Central beach and Lookout beach, taking place between 11:45 pm and midnight on New Year's Eve Namntu said, "cruelty to animals has been the major reason to say let's explore other options". The council said this year's display is a pilot project to test the concept.
