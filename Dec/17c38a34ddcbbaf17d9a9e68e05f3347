The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance boycotted proceedings in protest of Molwele being installed. The DA now wants to take action against two of its members, who refused to leave. The party is also seeking legal advice on the proceedings held.

While the EFF and DA boycotted the extraordinary meeting - the provincial government says everything is above board. “Hence we had written to the municipal manager and we are happy, we are disappointed two parties didn’t come here and not good for democracy,” said Gauteng Co-Operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile.

The ANC says it’ll now focus on working with coalition partners and ensure service delivery happens.
