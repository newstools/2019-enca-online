The Koeberg nuclear power station once failed apparently due to a bolt being placed in the reactor. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you That was in 2006 and to date, no one has ever been arrested or charged. Ramaphosa said decisive action needs to be taken against the sabotage at Eskom. Eskom asked that customers reduce their use of electricity as a decrease in collective demand would ease the load on the system. Consumers can check the schedules for when they are meant to be without power on their municipal websites and social media.
