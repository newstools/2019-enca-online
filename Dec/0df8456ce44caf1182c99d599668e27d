Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Trade unions are up in arms over SAA's decision to appoint Les Matuson as business rescue practitioner. They say the entire process was illegitimate and they were not involved. READ: We will shut down aviation: Numsa Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said they noted the decision to undergo the business rescue process but stated the process lacks legitimacy as it did not involve labour unions. “What is deeply concerning is that if they going to continue on this path, then as far as we concerned, this is not business rescue but liquidation under the cover of business rescue. We say this because we do not trust the management, the board and even DPE [ Department of Public Enterprises] when it comes to this process,” she added. Numsa insisted that previous CEO-Vuyani Jarana be brought on to the business rescue team as a consultant with specialist knowledge. Hlubi-Majola said the union has lost trust in the board and rejects the rescue plan.
