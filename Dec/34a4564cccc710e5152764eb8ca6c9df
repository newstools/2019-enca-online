File: Residents are being urged not to panic and to use water sparingly. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom's load-shedding could have an adverse impact on Cape Town and Johannesburg water supply. Cape Town is warning residents that should Eskom’s Stage 6 load-shedding continue, there could be intermittent water supply in some areas, while Johannesburg says it's unable to pump water into high lying areas due to current load-shedding. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you In a statement, the City of Cape Town said load-shedding of this severity is likely to constrain the ability to provide water supply in the reticulation system across the whole of the city in the usual way. Pumps for both the water and sewerage systems cannot operate properly without power for significant periods.
