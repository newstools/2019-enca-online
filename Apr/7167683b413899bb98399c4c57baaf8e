A Ugandan woman has been dubbed the most fertile. The 39-year old is mother to 44 children, although 6 have died -- and they're all from the same man. KASAWO - The average woman will have on average 2.5 children but Mariam Nabatanzi is no average woman. She has borne a total of 44 offspring, of which 38 still survive.
Nabatanzi explained, "it is true the children are all mine. I don't regret anything and I love them and I am so proud of them because I am the only mother to those children." "I got married when I was a child and God blessed me." READ: Migrant children in SA can't be denied schooling Nabatanzi is 39-years old. She had her first set of twins a year after she was married at the age of 12. These were followed by five more sets of twins, four sets of triplets and five sets of quadruplets. Six of her children have since died. After the birth of her first set of twins Nabatanzi went to a doctor who informed her, she had unusually large ovaries. She said she was told birth control would cause her health problems and since then the children have just kept coming.
Life has not been easy for Nabatanzi and her offspring. Three years ago, her husband abandoned her, leaving her to support the children on her own. She does everything from hairdressing, collecting and selling scrap metal, to selling herbal medicine, to provide for her children's basic needs.
