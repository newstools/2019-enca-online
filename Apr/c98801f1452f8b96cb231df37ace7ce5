READ: BLF remains on ballot paper ahead of elections The former Free State premier is claiming state organs are being used for political battles but Cosatu says Magashule must come clean. “This issue there is no evidence that the SG is providing,” said Cosatu president Zingiswa Losi. “At least at that space, he was talking at that platform this is the evidence, perhaps he would give it to the relevant authorities I'm not sure whether it would be the same authorities that he's complaining about. “Bugging of cellphones has always been there even during the Zuma administration, remember when the SACP leaders complained about this matter and it was seen as if the SACP leaders are just taking themselves too seriously.”
