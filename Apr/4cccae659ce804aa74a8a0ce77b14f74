There seems to be no reprieve for South Africans. The petrol price is going up again. This is the second highest on record. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Energy Department says it will not intervene in the latest petrol price which will see South Africans paying an extra 54 cents a litre from Wednesday. In 2018, there was a call from opposition parties and the ANC to freeze the fuel levy, which contributes significantly to the petrol price. This is said to be the second highest petrol price hike on record and the department says last year’s assistance was a once-off intervention. READ: Petrol price to go up in May Factors such as a weaker Rand/dollar exchange rate and the price of Brent Crude oil contribute to the rise in the fuel price. Economist Vivian Atude says the government needs to come up with proper mechanisms to deal with the fuel price. “Remember because of the volatility in our currency the Rand, the energy department has no other mechanism than to increase the fuel based on fluctuations.” Motorists are being urged to try and save costs where possible.
