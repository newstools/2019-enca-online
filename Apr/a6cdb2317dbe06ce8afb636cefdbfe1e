Model Halima Aden attends House Of Uoma presents the launch of Uoma Beauty - The World's First "Afropolitan" Makeup Brand at NeueHouse Hollywood in Los Angeles. WASHINGTON -Â Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit issue, best known for its racy covers of scantily clad bikini models, will feature for the first time a Muslim model wearing a hijab and burkini, the magazine said on Monday. Somali-American model Halima Aden's rookie spread will be set in Kenya, where she born in a refugee camp and lived until the age of seven. "Growing up in the States, I never really felt represented because I never could flip through a magazine and see a girl who was wearing a hijab," Aden said in a video tweeted by the magazine.

Halima, 21, made headlines at age 19 when she was the first woman to wear a hijab in the Miss Minnesota USA Pageant, where she made the semi-finals in 2016. She has previously featured on the cover of British Vogue and walked on the New York Fashion Week runway.
