Kwekwe explained her family often doesn't have enough food and she's in indebted to many in her village.

Every time it rains the structure becomes more unsafe. Fono is the eldest grandchild, she has completed her matric and has certificates in first aid and brick-laying.
She explained, "life is hard, we can't do anything for ourselves. We don't work." "Every time I apply for jobs I don't even get called for interviews. This house could collapse on us any time because it's held together by tree branches. The branches are moulding."
Fono had wanted her grandmother to enjoy her last days and she's still holding out hope that she can find a job and rebuild their home.
