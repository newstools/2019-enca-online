Immunisation saves millions of lives every year and is widely recognized as one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions. #eNCA JOHANNESBURG - The Health Department has launched the Immunization Coverage Survey and is appealing to residents across the country to participate. Dr Nonhlanhla Dlamini says the purpose of the survey is to find out if children are receiving all their vaccinations. "We want to know, in South Africa, how many children are actually fully vaccinated? Do they get all the immunizations they are meant to get? and if not, why not?" SA's ability to manage epidemic weak: WHO "Are there children who are getting some of the immunizations and are there some children who don't get any at all We are going to use this information to improve services", said Dlamini. 1.1 million households are expected to be covered by the department during the survey. "What I am appealing to our households is that if your household is chosen for our interviewers to come to your house, please allow them to come in and the questions will take 20-30 minutes and that information will help us to improve services."
