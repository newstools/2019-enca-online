Two bodies are still missing and an estimated 1,469 people are homeless. Durban will have to come up with more than R658-million towards the repairs.

"Obviously there are those that had to do the burials within the 24 hours, the ones that have done last weekend and the ones that are doing this week, the government will continue to provide that support.” Those who have lost their property will also receive government assistance but it’s unclear clear how long the rebuilding will take.
