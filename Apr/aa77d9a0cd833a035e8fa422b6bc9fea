Ramaphosa says the various commissions delving into state capture in the country will reveal the extent of state capture within the party. Ramaphosa: 'More revelations to come at state capture inquiry' Ramaphosa said, “before the state was captured, the ANC was captured." "The state institutions were targeted, but they found a way through utilising people within our own ranks, and that's something we've admitted." "Let me say, you don't hear other parties admitting to their errors, like the ANC, and that will make the renewal process much, much easier,” he said. A number of senior ANC officials have been implicated at the Zondo commission. The ANC has previously called on the public or anyone with information to come forward and testify at the inquiry.
