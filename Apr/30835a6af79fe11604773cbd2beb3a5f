South African Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya looks on after running the 1.500m senior women final at the ASA Senior Championships at Germiston Athletics stadium, in Germiston on the outskirts of Johannesburg. LAUSANNE Switzerland - The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) will rule on Wednesday on South African athlete Caster Semenya's challenge against new IAAF rules designed to regulate testosterone levels in female athletes.

World champion Semenya is challenging an International Association of Athletics Federations ruling seeking to force so-called "hyperandrogenic" athletes or those with "differences of sexual development" (DSD) to seek treatment to lower their testosterone levels below a prescribed amount if they wish to continue competing as women. World athletics' governing body has argued the moves are necessary to create a "level playing field" for other female athletes. Double Olympic champion Semenya, who has dominated the women's 800 metres over the last decade, took her fight to the world's top sports court which initially said it would announce a decision in March before the parties filed additional documents.
