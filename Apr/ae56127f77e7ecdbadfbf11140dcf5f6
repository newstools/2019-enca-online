While on the campaign trail in the Free State last weekend, Magashule claimed he is being spied on. However, the former Free State premier won’t say when he laid the complaint with the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence, Setlhomamaru Dintwe. “I’ve laid a complaint with the IG [Inspector General] and I think, let’s leave it there,” Magahsule said. “That’s a matter between me and the IG.” READ: Cosatu demands Magashule provide spy proof claims With a week to go before elections, the ANC is upping the ante in the Western Cape.
