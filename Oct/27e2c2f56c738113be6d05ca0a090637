Australia's David Warner speaks with Steve Smith after victory during the Twenty20 match between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Gabba in Brisbane on Wednesday. BRISBANE - David Warner and Steve Smith each smashed half-centuries as Australia hammered Sri Lanka by nine wickets to win the second Twenty20 in Brisbane on Wednesday and wrap up the series. It was another massive wake-up call for the Sri Lankans, who arrived in Australia on the back of a 3-0 series win against Pakistan but have now been outplayed twice, after being crushed by 134 runs in Adelaide on Sunday. They must now regroup for the third and final match in Melbourne on Friday. Warner and Smith came together after Aaron Finch was caught down the leg side off Lasith Malinga for a golden duck, and the pair produced a batting masterclass. Warner was unbeaten on 60 and Smith not out 53. Chasing 118 to win after Sri Lanka were restricted to 117 all out off 19 overs, they reached their target with 42 balls to spare.

"It's nice and easy batting at the other end from Davy," he added. "He's doing a terrific job. Played beautifully the other day and backed it up tonight as well." Warner scored his first-ever T20 century when Australia crushed Sri Lanka on Sunday, and he brought that scintillating form into Brisbane. In his first knock in the short format at international level since 2016, Smith was also firing -- producing some glorious drives and clever singles as he and Warner raced each other to see who could make 50 first. The explosive Warner won the battle, with his 14th T20 half-century coming off 30 balls, with seven fours. Smith soon followed, grabbing his third 50, off 32 balls, with six boundaries. There was nothing the Sri Lankan bowlers could do against such quality batsmen, who were never troubled.
