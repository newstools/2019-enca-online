Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Desperate and despondent. Refugees have been camping outside the United Nations Human Rights Commission's office in Pretoria for two weeks now. They're asking the UN to help them leave South Africa, following the August violence against foreigners. Among these refugees is Byarurema Kalond. He fled his home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo after rebels tried to recruit him. READ: Hundreds of foreigners camp outside UN offices, demand to leave SA “They want to take me by the force to join them to go fighting the government. Look my hands I don’t have power to take a gun to go fighting.” After his narrow escape, he sought refuge in South Africa. But, he's still running, this time from those who are using violence to try and force him and other foreigners to go back to the DRC. Kalond has been working as a car guard but had to leave his job after his family was threatened. His six children are camping here with him and his wife. Earlier this month, a sit-in was also staged at the UN offices in Cape Town, with refugees saying they no longer feel safe here.
