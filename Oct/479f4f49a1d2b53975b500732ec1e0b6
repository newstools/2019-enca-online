The Walter Sisulu University's Varsity Cup rugby team is waiting for Sunday's kick-off. TOKYO - For all of South Africa's physical dominance of Japan in their Rugby World Cup quarter-final, the Springboks are aware that they were lucky to get away with a 26-3 win after they squandered several point-scoring opportunities. Rassie Erasmus's side face Wales in a semi-final in Yokohama on Sunday where they are unlikely to get as many chances against the Six Nations champions. "We must find those pressure points ... (and) when we get the opportunity, we must utilise them," Erasmus said after his side wasted three or four chances to put their quarter-final beyond doubt by halftime. "Then we have a chance." The Springboks have not advanced to the World Cup final since they lifted the Webb Ellis trophy in Paris in 2007, and at times in the first half they were scrambling against a fast-paced Japanese side in the cool Tokyo conditions. The key to their victory, however, was laid in that troubled first half when the much bigger Springboks hurt the Japanese in the collisions. In previous matches the home side were able to get quickly to their feet, but on Sunday it was noticeable how many stayed down or rose slowly, holding their ribs, shoulders and lower backs due to the impact of the collisions. "I know a lot of people see a few holes in our defence, but we trust our system," Erasmus said. "We know defence is a pretty important thing if you want to win the World Cup. We have good confidence in our defence system."
