Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - In the business of life, it’s often hard to have a little fun but for two elderly best friends, it's all about living each moment to the fullest. What started off as simply capturing memories of their daily lives has turned them into internet sensations. Vuyelwa Halana and Nomvuyo Tshuni are living their best lives and documenting it all in fun videos. “We are people who love taking photos. I take lots of photos and videos and post them on my WhatsApp status. It turns out that my nephew was stealing the videos and posting them on Facebook,” Halana said. “We don’t know how Facebook works. We were mad at first and if we had seen him, we would have punished him."

At first we did not like it but now that we see our videos are putting smiles on people’s faces, we are loving it,” Tshuni said. The duo says while having fun as you grow older is important, that’s not the only thing keeping their bond strong. “Friendship is about loving each other, trusting each other and being there for each other no matter what,” Tshuni said.
