Tumisang Moumakoe is the founder of the online dictionary 'Mzansi Taal.' "One of the things that actually inspired this was researching my history and not finding enough data so now you have to start putting pieces together", said Moumakoe. Heritage Day: Keeping indigenous languages alive The online dictionary, which includes translations for words such as '2 bob' and 'tiger', has already been embraced by South Africa's largest university, Unisa. The institution's Linguistics Department is working on a formal collaboration with Moumakoe.
“We are using it as an OER, an open educational resource where students are being referred to it to source certain terms or if there is a test with the term then students use the site to reference.” South Africans can join in and submit words from their area but thorough research is done before a word appears on the site.
