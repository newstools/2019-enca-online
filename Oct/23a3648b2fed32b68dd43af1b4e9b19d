Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - KZN whistleblower Thabiso Zulu said he found out about a plot to assassinate him a day before the failed attempt. He survived a shooting on Saturday in Pietermartizburg. Zulu has been vocal over the killing of his friend and late former ANC youth league secretary, Sindiso Magaqa. "I don't know who might be behind the attack but what I know is that on Friday, I got a call from someone who asked to see me urgently and that person briefed me fully that there is a plot to assassinate me in the next three or four days. READ: Police probe attempted murder case after Thabiso Zulu shot I have a recording of that conversation, it is someone who is part of security somewhere. There was nothing I could have done after that because I have been telling the police about different things and even if I had reported that to the police, nothing would have been done", said Zulu. He said despite numerous reports that his life is under threat, he is yet to be provided with security. "I have not received any protection, I have not even received any communication from any person from the state, to say they are willing to try and start preparing that I get such. I have spoken to ministers and some senior people in government but there seems to be nothing that is moving towards the direction of affording me protection." Zulu said the attacks will not deter him.
