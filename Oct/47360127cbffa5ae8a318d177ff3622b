Last year, Eskom issued notices to five municipalities in the province, including Mooi-Mpofana in the Midlands, Ulundi, AbaQulusi and éDumbe all in northern KZN. Most have made payment arrangements with the exception of the Newcastle Municipality. Newcastle is the biggest culprit but it's not alone in owing millions to Eskom.

Municipalities that made payment arrangements had to revise their budgets and cut some projects.

Newcastle Municipality and Eskom are set to face-off in court on Thursday over a more than R200-million debt.
