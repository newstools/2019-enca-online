Ousted by the ANC in February 2018 after two terms in power marked by corruption allegations and economic stagnation, Zuma has repeated his claim that the charges are a politically motivated conspiracy. Outside court on Tuesday, Zuma ascended a mobile stage to a chorus of ululations and his campaign song, telling the crowd that he deserved a clear explanation of why his stay of prosecution application was denied.
