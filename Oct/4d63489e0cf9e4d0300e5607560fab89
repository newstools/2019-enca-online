JOHANNESBURG - Qualifying standards for major sporting events are a headache that refuses to go away for Sascoc. The Olympic body will not back athletes and teams it does not see as realistic medal prospects at competitions. Athletes and sports teams looking to force their way to major events without the support of Sascoc will not find recourse at the door of the Sports Ministry. "Sascoc's view on the Olympics, we share it, that not everybody should go to the Olympics," Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa said in August.
