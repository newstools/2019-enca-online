The National Assembly has reluctantly signed off another bailout of R59-billion for the power utility. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties are not happy after the National Assembly reluctantly signed off another bailout of R59-billion for Eskom. Some of them believe the money won't solve the struggling power utility's problems. WATCH: Eskom granted R59bn bailout Opposition parties say the power utility is holding them to ransom with load-shedding. WATCH: Eskom bailout: Parliament says no more blank cheques According to Democratic Alliance MP, Ashor Sarupen, the bill, in its present form, is a blank cheque for more of the same. "It rewards a culture of state capture and theft. It diminishes the importance of oversight and accountability for public money." Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, insists consumers must pay up but admits Eskom's problems are about more than money. "Go mobilise your supporters to surrender unto Eskom what belongs to Eskom. Key problems to solve at Eskom is to find the right people to run Eskom. Competent management, a competent board to hold accountable." The National Council of Provinces will have to approve the bailout before it's signed into law by the president. Watch the video above for more.
