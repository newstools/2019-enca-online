Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance looks set to face its fiercest leadership contest since the 2015 succession battle, from which Mmusi Maimane emerged as the leader. The party will this week debate an all-important organisational review and elect a new federal executive chairperson. Maimane could end up taking the fall for the outcome of the organisational review he ordered and that's even though he has said it's not intended to be a referendum on his leadership. READ: Maimane revelations motivated by DA factionalism: expert Athol Trollip, former DA leader Helen Zille, and federal council deputies, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters will be lobbying fiercely to succeed James Selfe as federal executive chairperson. Selfe has held the position for almost two decades. The federal council could set the ball rolling to challenge Maimane's leadership before the next elective congress.
