CAPE TOWN - Philippi farmers are rising up to save Cape Town's so-called "bread basket". The Philippi Horticultural Area provides 50 percent of the city's fresh produce and also has an aquifer running under it, making its protection even more crucial. They're asking the Western Cape High Court to review government's approval of possible development there. The farmers have been campaigning since 2011 when the Western Cape government approved the proposal.

But the provincial government says there are no plans to touch land used for farming. The matter continues in the High Court.
