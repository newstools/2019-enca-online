Outa says the system is flawed and open to corruption. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s renewed AARTO legislation promises harsh penalties for those who flout the rules of the road. "The Act promotes responsible behaviour on our roads through the creation of a demerit system, which introduces meaningful consequences for reckless, negligent and inconsiderate conduct,” Ramaphosa said.
