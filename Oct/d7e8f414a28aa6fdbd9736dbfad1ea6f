The National Weather Service issued a rare extreme red flag warning for Southern California for gusts that could be the strongest in more than a decade LOS ANGELES - Destructive wildfires have ripped through California, threatening homes and famous landmarks, and forcing power outages that have plunged millions into darkness. Everything from climate change to corporate negligence has been blamed for the chaos, which has seen hundreds of thousands evacuated, and hundreds of structures destroyed. But how do these fires compare to previous years? Though terrible in terms of sheer size and destruction, this year's wildfires in California are not setting any records. READ:Â California braces for powerful winds that could feed fires The 20 worst California wildfires on record all destroyed over 500 structures, or burned 140,000 acres, according to state agency Cal Fire. This year's biggest -- the Kincade Fire -- has destroyed 206 structures over 76,825 acres so far. Remarkably, there have been no fatalities. Last year, a single fire that destroyed the town of Paradise killed 86 people. But the threat has not passed. Dangerous winds were set to fan flames through Thursday, and some of California's worst blazes have struck as late as December. "We are still at this point not out of the woods in terms of fire season, and we won't be until there is significant rainfall in both northern and southern California," said Crystal Kolden, a University of Idaho scientist who specializes in wildfires.
