JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has apologised to the country and especially matriculants for the current round of load-shedding. Stage 2 has been implemented on Thursday, again until 11pm. READ: Stage 2 load-shedding to continue Thursday Eskom is urging residents and businesses to use power sparingly as they try and restore some of the power utility's generating units. Eskom said in a statement, it regrets the inconvenience and customers are reminded to treat all electrical points as live during this period. They say regular updates on the status of the power system will be provided through all the media platforms and will include the relevant times that load-shedding will be implemented on the day. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you Eskom says Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. Last month Eskom assured customers that there were no plans to implement power cuts this month, but that the risk remained high as the system was vulnerable.
