 by 360sport JOHANNESBURG - Winning one of the world's iconic races is a praiseworthy achievement. The Comrades Marathon Association, as part of the 2020 race launch event, presented Gerda Steyn and Edward Mothibi with their winners' medals - Ioz of 24-carat gold - and prestigious winners' jackets. The two champions are remarkably small but they create a presence of quiet confidence. They have evidently gained the respect of their peers.   Entries for the 2020 Comrades, taking place on Sunday 14 June, opens on Monday 28 Oct 2019. It offers an increased field of 27,500 runners. Race organiser Rowyn James expects entries to sell out within 4 days, so runners are advised to get moving and enter. Total prize money for 2020 totals R4.44-million and winners beating the previous best time will be rewarded with R525,000. Are you training yet?
