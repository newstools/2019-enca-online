 by 360Sport The WeBuyCars Curro Schools inaugural indoor 60m dash athletics event proved to be a roaring success as more than 500 athletes dashed down the specially imported track to supportive spectators on Wednesday, 16 October. Despite the power cuts the energy in the warehouse was at an ultimate high as the sprinters sped down the track every 3 minutes. The 5 lane track lived up to expectation and the athletes quickly adapted to ‘ spike less’ sprinting either running barefoot, with taped toes or running shoes. The u/18 girls winner Christine Umeh from Jeugland clocked a time of 7,20 sec and boys u/18 winner, John Adesola from Maragon an impressive 6,10 secs. The event proved a huge success and athletes could in future see the event being staged at the many other WBC warehouse located across South Africa.
