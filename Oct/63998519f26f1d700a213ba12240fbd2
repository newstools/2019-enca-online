JOHANNESBURG - A live on-air debate with three DA candidates was cancelled because it did not adhere to the party's code of conduct. This is according to the party's federal council election presiding officer, Desiree van der Walt. The broadcast was scheduled to go out at 9pm. The party held a press conference earlier to discuss the upcoming council meeting set for the weekend.
