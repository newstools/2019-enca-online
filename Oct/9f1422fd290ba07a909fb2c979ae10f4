READ: Protesting taxi drivers bring N7-highway to standstill Roads in the area have been periodically opened and closed since last Wednesday due to violent protests sparked by a dispute between taxis and the City. "The main reasons for the strike to take place is because of the impoundment of taxis and the operators, which are drivers, took a decision that they are going to park the taxis and they started the protest." "After that, owners were informed and we approached the owners as community leaders to say the strike must end," said ward councillor Lubabalo Makeleni. On Tuesday morning reports of tyres and a car being burnt on the N7 south-bound at Malibongwe Road and the N7 north-bound at Plattekloof Road led to the freeway being closed in both directions. However, City of Cape Town traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said the N7 had been reopened. "The N7 has been reopened and traffic is moving. Police are in the area to monitor the situation but so far traffic is moving freely", said Bezuidenhout.
