 PRETORIA - Athletes of Curro Schools in Gauteng will be defying their mothers and participating in a 60-meter dash running between the cars parked in a warehouse in Silver Lakes, Pretoria.

Junior and senior school athletes from Curro Hazeldene, Curro Roodeplaat, Curro Woodhill, Cornwall Hill, Willow Heights, HS Jeugland and others will be in action.
 
The event is expected to be intense with a heat or final race taking place every 3 minutes for about 5 hours with athletes running barefoot or with taped toes.
