DURBAN - The South African National Taxi Council in KZN hosted its annual sports day, bringing together six hundred taxi operators in a bid to unite the industry. Taxi operators took part in various sporting activities, including soccer, athletics and indigenous games. Women in the industry, who make up the bulk of the operators, were not left out.

Santaco says they have seen positive results from hosting the annual sports event and believe this year’s edition will have a similar impact.
