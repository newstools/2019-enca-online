Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma raises his bat after scoring a century (100 runs) during the first day's play of the first Test match between India and South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam on October 2, 2019. VISAKHAPATNAM - Rohit Sharma smashed a century in his first start as Test opener as India reached 202 without loss at tea on the opening day of their series against South Africa on Wednesday. Sharma - a star of India's limited-overs teams - reached 115 and Mayank Agarwal 84 after the hosts elected to bat first in Visakhapatnam and made South Africa toil. Sharma completed his fourth Test century in the second session with a single off debutant spinner Senuran Muthusamy to raucous cheers from the home crowd. He hit five sixes and 12 fours from 174 balls faced up to the break and showed frequent glimpses of the form that has made him a feared one-day batsman. READ: India look to Sharma to seal Test record against SA Agarwal, like Sharma, also used his feet to good effect against the South African spinners who struggled on the batting-friendly pitch. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis rotated his spinners, led by Keshav Maharaj, for a large part of the day with intermittent spells from pacemen Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander. India, who top the Test World Championship rankings, are looking for a record 11th Test series win at home. A sudden thunderstorm forced the umpires to call tea seven minutes early.
