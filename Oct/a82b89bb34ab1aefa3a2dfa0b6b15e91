FILE:  Global warming will continue to worsen flooding no matter how aggressively humans curb carbon emissions. PARIS - Coastal areas currently home to 300 million people will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how aggressively humanity curbs carbon emissions, scientists said Tuesday. By mid-century and beyond, however, choices made today will determine whether Earth's coastlines remain recognisable to future generations, they reported in the journal Nature Communications. Destructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study. More than two-thirds of the populations at risk are in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand.

"Sea-level projections have not changed," co-author Ben Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central, a US-based non-profit research group, told AFP. "But when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas that we previously understood." With the global population set to increase two billion by 2050 and another billion by 2100 -- mostly in coastal megacities -- even greater numbers of people will be forced to adapt or move out of harm's way.
