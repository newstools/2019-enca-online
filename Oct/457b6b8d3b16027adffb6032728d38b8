Jeremy Maggs speaks to the City of Johannesburg's Nthathisi Modingoane about developments in investigations into hackers attempts to breech the city's website. JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg says initial reports indicate no-one's personal data has been compromised by an attempted cyber attack. The city's website was shut down early this morning, following an apparent hack by a group calling themselves Shadow Kill Hackers. It's reported that they are demanding a ransom of 4.0 bitcoins before Monday or they'll release all data on the internet. City of Johannesburg spokesman Nthatisi Modingoane says the head of IT has been unable to confirm the ransom demand. He says the security breach was detected early. He says the website was shut down, to protect the data and efforts are underway to ensure that most services are back up by the weekend. "We are doing everything to restore some of the critical functionalities so that people can transact with the city." Modingoane said this was a clear and well-planned attempt by hackers. City officials are working with the Group Forensic Investigation Services to investigate the alleged threat by the hackers.
