Mashaba said far-right wingers have infiltrated the DA. READ: I'll stay in my lane: Zille Zille invited Mashaba to discuss any issue he may have with the party. “I have been with the party since the Progressives many years ago,” Zille said. “Herman will also remember that when he was being a very successful businessman, and I take off my hat to him for being an entrepreneur and a highly successful one in days where there were huge obstacles in his path, he will remember that while he was making a fortune in business, I was hiding Umkhonto we Sizwe operatives in my house and I was exposing the murder of Steve Biko. “So I don’t know what these right-wingers are that he is referring to.” READ: De Lille: 'I warned Maimane' On Sunday, Zille was elected chairperson of the DA’s federal council narrowly beating Athol Trollip. Her election comes despite reservations by DA leader Mmusi Maimane and his supporters about her return to politics. Maimane and Zille’s relationship has soured since she tweeted about colonialism, and her election could weaken his grip on the party’s direction.
