Gasa has been admitted as an attorney in the North Gauteng High Court It took the retired teacher 14 years to get here and he says the secret is simple. "If you want to get something, you need to work hard to reach that goal," he said. "You don't just achieve by wishing to achieve and not exert yourself." Gasa has accepted that he may be a little too old for court, but that's not going to stop him as he's on the lookout for ways to put his studies to good use.
