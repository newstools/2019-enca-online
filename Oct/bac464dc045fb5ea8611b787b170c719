Generation E, in partnership with the Transport department and the energy sector, is trying to demonstrate that electric cars could be the new solution to combat air pollution. A full charge of the electric car can cover 330 kilometres in the city and on an open road, 250 kilometres. “Electric vehicle have a lot less of maintenance than the internal combustion engines, purely because there’s just a less going on," said Generation E CEO Ben Pullen. "Internal combustions they’re masterpieces but maybe we moving into an era were these cars belong in a museum.” READ: Is South Africa ready for the electric car? Engineers say although the car is fun to drive, its speed limit is less than regular cars “This car can reach about 150 to 156 kilometers per hour, zero to hundred is just about 8 seconds. It’s not slow by any means but again our speed limit only allows us to drive about 120 in highways,” said Janus Janse Van Rensburg, Nissan chief marketing manager. If you're worried about load-shedding, the smart car can help you out. “You can actually set the car to put electricity from the battery back to your house, to run your house in the period of load shedding,” said Janse Van Rensburg.
