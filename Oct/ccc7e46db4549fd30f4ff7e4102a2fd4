Cheslin Kolbe and Faf de Klerk greet fans after the match against New Zealand. SPONSORED: The Springboks should move one step closer to securing their place in the next round of the Rugby World Cup when they meet Italy in Shizuoka on Friday. As it stands, Italy currently occupy top spot in Pool B with two bonus point victories to their name. However it is all rather flattering when you consider that they have faced Namibia and Canada in their two games so far. This is their first tough encounter. The Springboks will go level on points should they claim a bonus-point win but if that is the case then their superior points difference should see them restore order in the group. New Zealand are very much on track to top proceedings with the Springboks through as the second team to advance. It is reflected in the available odds with South Africa 1/33 to get the job done against the 22/1 on the Italians. The handicap sees South Africa (-28.5) vs Italy (+28.5) at 9/10 either way. The Winning Margin market has South Africa over 12.5 at 1/7, South Africa under 12.5 at 4/1 and Italy Under 12.5 at 25/1. You can get some 3/1 on South Africa 21-30 on the Alternative Winning Margin market or 33/10 on South Africa 31-40. South Africa 11-20 is at 7/2. There have been 14 meetings between these two teams since 1995 and the Springboks have dominated, winning 13 of those. Their only blemish came in 2016 when losing 20-18 in Firenze in a disastrous year in Springbok rugby history. They righted that wrong the very next year with a comprehensive 35-6 win. You can take some of the 28/10 on South Africa by 1-15 points when trying to back the Exact Winning Margin or there’s 3/1 on South Africa by 44+. South Africa by 28 is next best with South Africa by 29 at 16/1. You can get even money on South Africa by 15+ by the time the half time whistle blows or there’s 28/10 on South Africa by 8-14 or South Africa by 1-7 at 33/10. Looking at the anytime Tryscorer, there’s 5/10 on Cheslin Kolbe or Makazole Mapimpi dotting down during the match or 9/10 on Malcolm Marx who will start from the bench for the encounter. You can get 12/10 on Bongi Mbonambi, who starts at hooker, adding a try of his own. There’s no denying that this seems another straight forward clash for the South African squad to get through. A wobble at this stage of the tournament doesn’t seem too likely even against an Italian side who will be confident after two big scoring wins against the minnows.
