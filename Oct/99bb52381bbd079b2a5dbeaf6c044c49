JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has announced stage two load-shedding on Wednesday between 9am to 11pm. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you The power utility says the load-shedding is due to a shortage of capacity. Last month Eskom assured customers that there were no plans to implement power cuts this month, but that the risk remained high as the system was vulnerable. This followed a statement issued by the Democratic Alliance regarding possible load-shedding. Customers have been advised to check their load-shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website and to use electricity sparingly.
