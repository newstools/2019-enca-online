SPONSORED Editor's note: This event is expected to start at 9am. JOHANNESBURG - Reviving South Africa's Nation Brand identity and narrative is the theme for this year's Nation Brand Forum. This was motivated by President Cyril Ramaphosa's remarks during his State of the Nation Address earlier this year, where he said, "I dream of the first new city built in the democratic era". The forum aims to "engage various stakeholders in order to develop a compelling and coherent narrative that tells the story of South Africa in a meaningful way, an integral part of managing the reputation and image of the Nation Brand." “We are proud to host the 4th Annual Nation Brand Forum, a platform  that inspires South Africans to find collaborative ways that ensure that we positively position the Nation Brand through constructive and introspective conversations with role players, to innovate and revive the identity and value proposition of what we are about as a nation, 25 years into democracy”; said Brand South Africa’s General Manager for Marketing Ms Sithembile Ntombela. Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu will be the keynote speaker. Panellists taking part in the discussion include Zanele Morrison, Director of Marketing and Corporate Affairs at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Doug Place, Chief Marketing Officer of Nando's and Veteran Broadcaster Joanne Joseph. Founder and CEO of the Brand Leadership Group, Thebe Ikalafeng will be the guest speaker.
