The SACP and Cosatu have accused the minister of not consulting them on his plan. Both alliance members attended the ANC national executive committee meeting at the weekend. Mboweni's economic plan drafted by consultants: EFF "Not on the core things, which are reversals, particularly the question relating to the national minimum wage for instance and the labour resistance regime. "In which, for instance, there was an intention to deregulate, basically to reverse the rights that workers have won in this country", said SACP General Secretary Solly Mapaila. The plan proposes reviewing regulations on everything from fuel to banking and suggests ways to get more tourists and immigrants into the country as South Africa battles with a contracting economy.
