JOHANNESBURG – The SABC has confirmed that it will broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup final between South Africa and England. Rugby fans without pay television could not watch the tournament, as the public broadcaster had not secured TV broadcast rights. SuperSport owns the rights to the Rugby World Cup in Sub-Saharan Africa.
