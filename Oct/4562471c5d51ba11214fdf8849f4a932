Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The story why Dudu Myeni hasn't pitched in court has changed. After her third no-show, Myeni’s legal team says what's needed is time, rather than money. Outa and SAA pilots are asking the courts to declare the former SAA chairperson a 'delinquent director'. First, she told the courts she didn't have enough money to travel to Pretoria from KZN or to pay lawyers.

Judge Ronel Tolmay made it clear to the team that Myeni may not fire them or get new legal counsel, as there have been too many delays. Both legal teams have until Monday to indicate any interlocutory applications and give lists of witnesses they intend to introduce. Trial is set down for about two weeks from now and will start with or without Myeni.
