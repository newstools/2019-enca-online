Vendors and clients walk by a wall plastered with Mozambican Presidential Election campaign posters. MAPUTO - Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi was forecast to be heading for a landslide victory in an election the opposition says has been tarnished by fraud, leaving some voters worried for the future of the country's fragile peace deal. Some polling stations recorded many more votes than registered voters in last week's ballot, the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) said. It said that Nyusi will win more than 70 percent of the vote against 21 percent for opposition candidate Ossufo Momade, according to data from 2,500 polling stations.

Analysts believe that could threaten an historic peace accord signed just months ago between Momade and Nyusi, and in turn the stability of nation on the verge of becoming a global gas exporter. A spokesman for the Electoral Administration Technical Secretariat did not respond to multiple requests for comment on fraud accusations nor the pace of the official count.

So far, Nyusi has taken 74.6 percent of the presidential vote versus 20.2 percent for Momade.
