JOHANNESBURG - A warrant of arrest has been issued for a man accused of stabbing his wife at least 19 times right in front of their two young children. eNCA previously reported how 40-year-old Lerato Makhavhu went into hiding with her 4-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son after the attack. Makhavhu began divorce proceedings last month before her estranged husband allegedly stabbed her at her Johannesburg home.

The NPA says he's been formally charged with attempted murder. "He is charged with a Schedule 5 offence and will have to bring a formal bail application," said NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane.
