A poster with a portrait of late president of the African National Congress (ANC), Oliver Tambo. JOHANNESBURG - Sunday marks the birthday of one of South Africa's best-loved sons. On this day in 1917, the revolutionary Oliver Tambo was born. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the keynote address during the commemoration service in Ekurhuleni. Tambo was the longest-serving ANC president and led the organisation from 1969 to 1991. He died in April 1993 at the age of 75, just one year before the historic 1994 general election. Adelaide Tambo, his wife, was also a prominent anti-apartheid activist. She died in January 2007 at the age of 77. The annual commemoration is aimed at preserving the legacy of the two liberation leaders and promoting a culture of selflessness.
