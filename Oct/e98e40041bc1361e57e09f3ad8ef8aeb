The area is where KwaZulu-Natal’s wealthier citizens live but, it’s also where the Hawks found R4-million in drugs and manufacturing equipment on Friday. The Hawks arrested a 37-year-old man in the heroin bust.

We gained access to the premises,” said Hawks Simphiwe Mhlongo. “Upon searching the premises that’s where the heroin which is 16kg was found and he was subsequently placed under arrest and charged accordingly.” READ: Police raid multi-million rand drug labs in Gauteng, Mpumalanga Investigators say criminals are always searching for areas where their activities can go undetected. “They like the secluded places, sometimes with the high security. I’m not saying they’re using the upper market areas, as you can see sometimes they use the farmhouse,” Mhlongo said. The suspect will remain in custody until his bail application next Monday.
