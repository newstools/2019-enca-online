File: London's stock market opened lower on Monday, with the pound higher awaiting confirmation that the European Union would allow a Brexit extension until the end of January. LONDON - The pound hit a fresh five-month peak above $1.30 on renewed Brexit optimism after Prime Minister Boris Johnson requested another extension to Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union. At about 0830 GMT, the pound reached the highest level since May at $1.3012. It later stood at $1.2984, unchanged from late in New York on Friday. The euro was stable at 85.99 pence.

"Whether that optimism turns out to be premature is another matter; only time will tell." Johnson was Monday attempting again to push his EU divorce deal through parliament and avoid the political damage of delaying Brexit beyond next week.

Since spiking above $1.30 in the morning London session, sterling has since slid back underneath.
