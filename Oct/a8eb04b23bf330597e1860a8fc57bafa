Eskom implemented stage two load-shedding on Wednesday due to a breakdown of some of the power utility's generating units. Last month Eskom assured customers that there were no plans to implement power cuts this month, but that the risk remained high as the system was vulnerable.

Customers have been advised to check their load-shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website and to use electricity sparingly.
