"The staff of the Chinese embassy in the UK is driving to the scene to verify this situation," the ministry said on its Weibo social account after British media reported that the victims were Chinese. The victims were discovered in a container on the back of a truck in Grays, east of London, on Wednesday, shortly after arriving by ferry from Belgium.
