Some 1,325 firefighters backed by air tankers and helicopters were battling the flames that raced toward densely packed communities and threatened 10,000 structures. LOS ANGELES - Wildfires raged across California, destroying homes and forcing evacuations as over 1,000 firefighters tackled flames in the southern part of the state alone. Tens of thousands of residents near Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles, fled their homes as the so-called Tick Fire scorched over 1,618 hectares and was only ten percent contained by Friday night. The blaze forced the shutdown of all schools in the area as well as a major freeway, creating a traffic nightmare for commuters.

Some 1,325 firefighters backed by air tankers and helicopters were battling the flames that raced toward densely packed communities and threatened 10,000 structures, officials said. Six homes were destroyed, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told a news conference, adding that the number was expected to rise. A red flag warning indicating ripe conditions for wildfire was in effect for more than 18 million people in the southern part of the state until Friday evening.

"It looks like another Santa Ana is coming," meteorologist Eric Boldt told AFP. "Right now, we're looking at moderate strength winds (Sunday and Monday)." Still, he added, the state remains "critically dry" with little humidity, creating an environment ripe for large and dangerous fire growth.
