Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - They say getting the body of your dreams takes 20 percent training and 80 percent diet. Personal trainer, Themba Mlombo, says the key to getting fit ahead of summer is to ensure that your diet is suitable for your body type. "You need to understand that you get three body types, you get your ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph. You need to understand which body type you fit in," says Mlombo.

While endomorph's are people who pick up weight around the waist and a mesomorph is a person who picks up and maintains muscle easily. "With an ectomorph, they don't have to watch how many calories they intake, they don't have to worry about keeping carbs, with an endomorph they have to worry about how much carbs they take in, they have to be aware not to eat food that stores calories. "If you are a mesomorph then you have to stay closer to your greens and proteins, things like asparagus, cabbage and spinach", adds Mlombo.
