October is transport month, and in a special focus we have decided to look at people's daily commute. Courtesy#DStv403 PRETORIA - Millions of South Africans use public transport for their daily commute. eNCA reporters Aviwe Mtila, Silindelo Masikane and Masego Rahlaga all put the most common forms of transport to the test in our very own eNCA Mzansi Race. The trio battled via train, taxi, and car to the Union Buildings. Winner Masego Rahlaga used her car and it took her two hours to arrive at the finish line by the Nelson Mandela statue. While runner up Silindelo Masikane took a taxi. After long queues and Monday traffic, Masikane arrived 15 minutes after our winner. Last but not least Aviwe Mtila started his long journey on the train which took him four hours to complete. eNCA reporters Aviwe Mtila, Silindelo Masikane and Masego Rahlaga all put the most common forms of transport to the test in our very own eNCA Mzansi Race.
