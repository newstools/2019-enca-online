"Without the right to publicly criticize those in power, like Gordhan, we are unable to exercise accountability over the executive and its decisions," the party said. "Long has Pravin Gordhan felt himself above the law. He has conducted himself as untouchable when he presided over cruel projects of espionage in The Rogue Unit. The EFF welcomes the court outcome and will continue its battle to expose Gordhan to the end." Gordhan lawyers say their client remains committed to political debate that deepens democracy and freedom for all South Africans and will continue to advise him on all options to seek recourse in his case against Malema.
