Kim Bi-o reacted angrily after he was startled by the shutter sound of a smartphone camera which affected his shot at the 16th hole at Sunday's DGB Financial Group Volvik Daegu Gyeongbuk Open.

The 29-year-old went on to win the tournament -- becoming the first two-time winner on the tour in 2019 -- and later apologised for losing his temper. On Tuesday, Kim kneeled in front of television cameras as he fought back tears and apologised again after attending an emergency KPGA meeting over his action. But the KPGA later said it had reached a unanimous decision to suspend the golfer for three years from the Korean tour with a fine of 10 million won (US$8,350).

Kim, who has six professional wins to his name, played on the US PGA Tour in 2011 after earning his place via Q-SChool. He also had two seasons on the second-tier Web.com tour.
