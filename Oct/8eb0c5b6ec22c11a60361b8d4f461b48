As Maimane ponders his next move, the DA is steaming ahead trying to find temporary replacements for him and former federal chairperson, Athol Trollip. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance is on autopilot, with the party expected to function with only an interim leader until April next year. It follows a legal opinion from the DA's Federal Legal Commission. An urgent Federal Council meeting's been convened after Mmusi Maimane broke all ties with the party. The umbilical cord has been cut. READ: DA announces new parliamentary leader Patricia De Lille, Lindiwe Mazibuko and Mmusi Maimane have been red-carded by Helen Zille. Seven years ago, Zille's chosen successor emerged as the first black leader of the party, but Maimane has served his erstwhile mentor with divorce papers. Zille's making no mention of her broken relationship with Maimane, choosing to focus on his resignation. "I want to wish Mmusi nothing but the best. He put in an enormous effort for the DA and for South Africa. He had the enormous courage to appoint an independent review committee to analyse where we had gone wrong and he had the courage to follow through on the recommendations," said Zille, DA Federal Council Chairperson.

In the meantime, the lobbying to replace Maimane's already started. His once right-hand man and former Chief Whip in Parliament, John Steenhuisen, has revealed he's been approached to take over the reins.
