The company is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and is owned by controversial media owner, Iqbal Survé. The PIC ignored warnings that it was investing in a company that was heavily overvalued but it went ahead anyway. The dismissal comes after almost a year of inquiry into the PIC. Now former assistant portfolio manager, Victor Seanie, has been shown the door but he is a small-fry in the Ayo deal while some of his superiors remain in office and others are on suspension.
