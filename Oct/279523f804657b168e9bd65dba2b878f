File: Hungry elephants have been breaking out of Zimbabwe's game reserves and raiding human settlements in search for food. HARARE - At least 55 elephants have died in a month in Zimbabwe due to a lack of food and water, its wildlife agency said Monday, as the country faces one of the worst droughts in its history. More than five million rural Zimbabweans - nearly a third of the population - are at risk of food shortages before the next harvest in 2020, the United Nations has warned. The shortages have been caused by the combined effects of an economic downturn and a drought blamed on the El Nino weather cycle.

Farawo said the park was overpopulated and that food and water was scarce "due to drought". "Hwange was meant for 15,000 elephants but at the moment we are talking of more than 50,000," Farawo said. "The situation is dire. We are desperately waiting for the rains."
