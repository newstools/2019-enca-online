Eskom's Medupi Power Station near Lephalale in Limpopo. JOHANNESBURG - Rugby fans will be pleased to learn that Eskom says there's no planned load-shedding for Sunday. However, the power utility says the system remains constrained and volatile. Eskom says that, while it's making every effort to limit load-shedding, it could be implemented at short notice. That is if there is a significant shift in plant performance and unplanned technical breakdowns. WATCH: Eskom gives update on load-shedding “While some units returned to service as planned, emergency diesel and water reserves had to be used...to supplement capacity, as generating units returned later than expected,” Eskom said. The power utility said it hopes to replenish its diesel reserves “so as to avoid and minimise load-sheding in the coming week.” Eskom added that repairs at Medupi power station are going well. Eskom is also urging consumers to try and use air conditioners at efficient levels during this heatwave period.
