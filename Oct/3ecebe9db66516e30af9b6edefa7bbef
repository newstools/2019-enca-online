CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says making her foot legal bills has set a dangerous precedent. Mkhwebane was speaking in Parliament where she presented her annual report. In August, the Constitutional Court told her to pay 15 percent of the Reserve Bank's legal fees from her own purse.

In the same month, the North Gauteng High Court ordered Mkhwebane to pay some of the legal fees of the DA and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution.

"I am still of the opinion that this is creating a lot of precedents because a lot of people who are lodging those reviews, they are using that route now to say there must be a personal cost over public protection," said Mkhwebane.
