JOHANNESBURG - It appears the ANC in Gauteng is on a mission to protect some of its members. It's rejected recommendations from the party's integrity commission to remove several members, including two who are linked to the VBS scandal. The commission in Gauteng, headed by Trevor Fowler, recommended that the mayors of Merafong and the West Rand be fired because of unlawful deposits in VBS.

This follows Mazibuko's outburst when she was Gauteng Sport and Recreation MEC. The committee said Mazibuko's outburst brought the ANC into disrepute. The Gauteng ANC is rejected the recommendations and, according to sources, would rather have the party's Top Six have a final say on the report.

Earlier this month, the commission said it would speed up the process of dealing with two senior Limpopo officials implicated in the VBS saga. The branches demanded that the ANC either reinstate them or begin the process of disciplinary hearings.
