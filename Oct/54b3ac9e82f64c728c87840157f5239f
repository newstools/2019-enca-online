CAPE TOWN - One of South Africa’s most famous exports, Rooibos tea, is being used to boost more than just your health. The Rooibos Council of South Africa has teamed up with a lingerie brand to create a bra made almost entirely of Rooibos tea bags. The SA Rooibos Council's Marthane Swart says Rooibos has a long history the Cancer Association of South Africa (Cansa) “We have a very long history with CANSA, especially if you consider the cancer-fighting properties of Rooibos. I have to give credit to our media agency, Meropa, they came up and said ‘we have this wonderful idea, why don’t we make a Rooibos bra.” The unique creation consists of 450 used Rooibos tea bags, with women from around the country sending in their used teabags. The bra will be auctioned off with proceeds going towards Cansa. Cansa says breast cancer is on the rise, with one in 27 women affected. #DStv403
