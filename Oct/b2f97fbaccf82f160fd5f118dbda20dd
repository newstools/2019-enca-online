Eskom was an easy target for state capture. And the project was effective.Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom was an easy target for state capture and the project was effective. But President Cyril Ramaphosa says now is not the time to apportion blame. As the power utility battles to put cash in the bank, he's told Parliament, government will be pulling out all the stops to ensure its survival. Ramaphosa was answering questions in the National Council of Provinces on Thursday. LIVESTREAM: President Ramaphosa Q&A in the NCOP "My own sense is if there ever was an entity of government that was completely captured it was Eskom. And it was easy to capture because they were able to see how big it is, the biggest corporation in our country generates revenue far above many other companies." He says a lot that went on at Eskom was hidden. But a blame game won’t fix the situation. READ: Eskom bailout: Parliament says no more blank cheques “So I was the leader of state capture project? Very nice. I think the honourable member is hallucinating a bit." Ramaphosa says if Eskom’s liquidity is to improve, consumers must pay.

We must pay our electricity bills just as we pay for our cellphones.” Ramaphosa says Eskom will remain the main electricity generator in South Africa. While partnerships with the private sector are encouraged, Eskom won’t be privatised.
