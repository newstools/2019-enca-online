DURBAN - The Education Department in Kwazulu-Natal is on a full-on-campaign to try and curb the scourge of violence in schools there. Just Tuesday, a Grade 11 pupil from Eastwood Secondary School was stabbed to death, allegedly by fellow pupils. The group had apparently quarrelled earlier that day. Another pupil was murdered on Wednesday in a suspected revenge attack.

"Our view is that these incidents that happen at school are a reflection of how troubled our society is," said Mshengu. "If you speak about violence, it starts with our communities." Mshengu said some learners are fighting along factional lines or the lines of gangsterism. "So that's where we need to start, we need our communities to eliminate all these instances right from where they get planned."
