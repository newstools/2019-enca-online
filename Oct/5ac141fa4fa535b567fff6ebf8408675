Minerals and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, is accused of paying journalists to stop a story about a supposed affair. JOHANNESBURG - Minerals and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, has denied bribery allegations. The Sunday World quoted him confessing to paying-off two of the publication's journalists. He allegedly gave them R70,000 to stop a story about a supposed affair, but Mantashe has rubbished the claims saying he believes in upholding the integrity of the media and media freedom. "As editor, I have a duty to call him and say who are these people because if these people are in this newsroom, I have a responsibility to ensure they suffer the consequences of their actions," said Mkahudu Sefari, Sunday World editor. The paper is now trying to establish who these journalists are. READ: Mantashe in hot water amid 'affair' bribery allegations "He asked, so you want the names?' and I said, yes uncle Gweezy. And he said, no no, I'm not going to give you the names," said Sefari. The South African National Editors Forum wants Mantashe to appear before a media ethics inquiry to account for his actions. "We want the minister to explain himself to this commission on why he decided to pay journalists, which is of course a criminal offence," said Adriaan Basson, Sanef Treasurer. Mantashe will face more heat in Parliament, where the DA has laid a complaint against him. "We took great exception to the fact that he was essentially bribing journalists not to do their job. That is in contravention of the code of conduct and members ethics of parliament," said Kevin Mileham, DA MP. Mantashe famously adopted the Chinese Communist Party's Tigers and Flies anti-corruption campaign which demands politicians maintain their integrity, but this may now come back to bite him.
