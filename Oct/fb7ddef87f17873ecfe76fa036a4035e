eNCA's Samkele Maseko has more. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Patricia De Lille says DA Leader Mmusi Maimane is getting the same medicine he once served to her. The Good Party leader says she warned Maimane against working with those who'd someday want him out. De Lille says its a case of what-goes-around-comes-around for Maimane. "If he (Maimane) had listened at the time when I told him that he was working with them to get me out, you are the spokesperson for this cabal, one day this cabal is going to turn on you. That's exactly what has happened." This comes as some of the DA's Federal Executives are preparing to defend the party leader. In the last month, Maimane has been accused of improperly benefiting from leasing a house from his business partner and refusing to return a Toyota Fortuner donated by Steinhoff. Maimane has called for an official investigation into his conduct by the DA. Watch the video above for more on this story.
