JOHANNESBURG - Convicted rapist Nicholas Ninow testified on Wednesday in mitigation of sentence. He broke down as he explained events leading to up to him raping a 7-year-old girl. Ninow assaulted her in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Pretoria last year. READ: Nicholas Ninow: 'I was using CAT' "It is difficult for me to describe what happened at that moment," he testified. "It is something that breaks me every day. It is something that I have to live with every day. It is something I can't take back." Ninow told the court he feels angry and hopeless and said even prison inmates and guards look down on him. Ninow's grandmother also took the stand, offering an emotional apology to the family of his victim.
