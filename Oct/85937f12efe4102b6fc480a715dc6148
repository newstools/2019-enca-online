TOKYO - Japan's Emperor Naruhito on Tuesday formally proclaimed his enthronement in front of royals and leaders from around the world, completing his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

Some 2,000 guests, including foreign dignitaries and royalty, stood at the sound of a deep drum beat before the proclamation began. When the ceremony was complete, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cried "Banzai!" ("long live the emperor") three times. Naruhito officially assumed his duties as emperor on 1 May, the day after his father became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries. But the transition was not complete until his new role was officially proclaimed. In the wake of Typhoon Hagibis, the government postponed a royal parade until 10 November, but the rest of the day's ceremonies were left unchanged.
