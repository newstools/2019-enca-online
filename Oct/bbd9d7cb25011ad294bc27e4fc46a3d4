Tensions are high along the border between Turkey and Syria. There's been widespread condemnation of Turkey's actions. However, Turkish President Erdogan has warned that he will open the gates for Syrian refugees in his country to migrate to Europe.

Soldiers waving Syrian flags deployed west of Tall Tamr, not far from the flashpoint border town of Ras al-Ain, which has been a key target of Turkish forces and their proxies since they launched their onslaught six days ago. Tall Tamr is about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the border but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said some units in the area had moved as close as six kilometres (four miles). AFP correspondents said the government forces were met by cheering residents and Syrian state television aired footage of people welcoming the soldiers.

On October 9, Turkey launched a broad cross-border offensive on areas that were controlled by Kurdish forces it considers to be a terrorist organisation. The move came after a pullback of US troops from the border area effectively gave Ankara a green light to launch its long-prepared operation. Tensions are very high on the border between Turkey and Syria. There has been a widespread international condemnation of Turkey's actions.
