Water levels in some parts of the capital city have dropped substantially due to the current maintenance of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. READ: Pupils rewarded for their innovative water systems Some reservoirs are less than half full and this situation could worsen with the maintenance project expected to be completed only at the end of next month. “In the north and west of the city reservoir levels are much lower at 40-percent and a bit lower, we urge residents to use water sparingly,” said Tshwane MMC for Utility Service Abel Tau. Tau has some tips for residents. "People must use the shower instead of taking a bath, collect clean water you get, the reality is our attitude towards water must change," he said.

Consumers in the western areas have been restricted to a third of normal supplies while some reservoirs are sitting on less than ten percent. Saving water is not an option but a must.
