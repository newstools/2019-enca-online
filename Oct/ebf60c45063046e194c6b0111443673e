That is because approximately 2 000 poor-quality second-hand tyres are being bought in South Africa every day. Annually, up to 1.5 million used tyres are sold, of which 750 000 should not even be on the road. Although you might think you are saving money by buying a second-hand tyre on the side of the road or from a dodgy small business, it could hurt your pocket in the long run. READ: SA motorists suffer over illegal tyre influx “If you have an accident, they will check your tyres. If they’re illegal, they’re below the 2 milimetres, they’re actually going to go back to you straight away and say your insurance claim is invalid, or there’s issues with your insurance”, said Darren Hayes-Powell from SA Tyre Manufacturers Conference. A good tyre could mean the difference between braking in time to avoid a collision or a deadly crash. “Good tread, new tyres or half-worn tyres, they do water dispersion, your braking will be better, your pull-away will be better,” added Tren Tyre Brackenfell manager, Rajie Filander.
