CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town dancer has freestyled his way into an international dance championship in France this month. Besides having his eye on the trophy, he's also proving you don't have to be defined by your circumstances. Twenty-six-year-old Lee Shane Booysen has been crowned South Africa's Red Bull Dance Your Style Champion. "Dance your style means to represent the dance style that you are predominately good at.Â I was fortunately enough to learn different style," says Booysen.

Come 12 October, he will be up against other talented dancers from over 30 countries. So what does this mean for a young man growing up on the Cape Flats? "Where I'm from people give up very easily, a challenge comes and they give up or they're broken down, I'm one of the fortunate people that was able to surround myself with people that could impact me that could change my mindset around how Mitchell's plan is. When I was younger my mind-set was I'm limited to just this because i grew up poor. For real it means the world to me, this is the biggest platform that a street dancer can enter. It's an honour for me," Booysen says So whether is popping, locking or breaking, Lee-Shane certainly has all the ingredients to take Paris by storm. Here's hoping he brings home gold.
