LOS ANGELES - A prequel series to global TV phenomenon Game of Thrones has been ordered, WarnerMedia announced, as it sent out launch details for its new HBO Max streaming service. The new show in George RR Martin's fictional world of Westeros will take place 300 years prior to fantasy epic Thrones and will be called House of the Dragon. The series will be based on the book Fire and Blood, which tells the story of the murderous, dragon-breeding Targaryen family. "It's my pleasure to announce today that we are ordering 'House of the Dragon' straight to series for HBO," Casey Bloys, president of programming, told a Los Angeles launch event for HBO Max. "It tells the story of House Targaryen and the early days of Westeros."
