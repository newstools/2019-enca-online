JOHANNESBURG - Motorists are being warned to be extra vigilant on the road as stormy weather is expected in parts of eastern South Africa. A developing low-pressure system over southern Botswana together with a fairly intense high-pressure system off the east coast of South Africa will maintain unsettled weather across the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and parts of the Limpopo, North West and Free State provinces. The Automobile Association (AA) said it is important for motorists to check if their windscreen wipers are working properly and to also check the condition of their tyres to avoid aquaplaning. READ: Storms predicted for eastern South Africa "Motorists need to ensure that they check the condition of the windscreen wipers, if their cars have been standing in the sun the whole time then they should have them checked out and if they don't work then they need to replace them. Tyres are also critical, should you need to stop or to manoeuvre then you will need your tyres, especially on slippery surfaces", said AA spokesperson Layton Beard. Below are additional tips from the association to help keep safe in wet conditions: 1. Keep a safe following distance 2. Buckle up 3. Concentrate on the road and avoid using electronic devices 4. Ensure your headlights and brake lights are working 5. Do not speed and avoid crossing low-lying bridges Meanwhile, the JMPD said officers will be deployed to various areas to assist motorists ahead of the expected rainfall. "Officers will be deployed and visible on all the major roads, especially the highways, including the N1, N3 and N7. Motorists are urged to be cautious and to obey the rules of the road", said JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar.
