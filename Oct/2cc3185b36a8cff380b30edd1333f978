Dean Furman of Supersport United lifts trophy during the MTN8 2019 Final football match between Highlands Park and SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium on 05 October 2019. SOWETO - Bradley Grobler, the most prolific scorer in South Africa this season, nodded the goal that gave SuperSport United a 1-0 win over Highlands Park on Saturday in the MTN8 final. The goal that earned the Pretoria club the winners-take-all R8.8 million prize came during the first minute of first-half stoppage time in Soweto. SuperSport broke down the right wing and Grobler, the son of star South African forward Les, soared in the middle of the six-yard box to head past goalkeeper Thelo Ngobeni. Grobler has scored seven goals in all competitions since the 2019/2020 season kicked off two months ago, one more than Namibian Peter Shalulile of Highlands Park. Highlands spurned a chance to level on 51 minutes when Spiwe Msimango hit the woodwork from close range.

It was the third successive appearance of SuperSport, a club bankrolled by a pay-to-view sport channel, in the MTN8 final with success in 2017 followed by failure last year. Victory in a tense but never thrilling match enabled coach and former Zimbabwe captain Kaitano Tembo to collect his first silverware after a trophy-less first season in charge. "We dominated the match and I wish to thank all those who bought into my philosophy and showed patience in me after a difficult first season in charge," said Tembo. "Failure to take our chances cost us the match," lamented Highlands coach and former Derry City forward Owen Da Gama. The MTN8 features the top eight finishers from the previous league season and is sponsored by a South Africa-based international mobile telecommunications company.
