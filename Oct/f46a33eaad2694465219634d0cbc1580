Party leader Mmusi Maimane and chairperson Athol Trollip have quit their positions. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance is leaderless. Party leader Mmusi Maimane and chairperson Athol Trollip have quit their positions. The party's Federal Executive must now decide what next. READ: Maimane quits as DA leader DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says it will seek legal advice on Thursday. “That will be the discussion of an urgent Federal Executive that's taking place tomorrow morning... there's a constitutional vacuum because the way the constitution was framed, was framed without anticipating that they'll be a scenario where the leader and the chairperson resign.” “So the discussion that will take place tomorrow will be guided by legal opinion that we'll be getting internally to follow the process that we need in term of having an interim leader until we go to the early congress,” added Malatsi. Maimane has, however, said he will continue as a parliamentary leader if the party allows him.
