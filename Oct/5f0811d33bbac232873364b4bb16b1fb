Georgia's lock Giorgi Nemsadze (L) and Wales' flanker Justin Tipuric jump for the ball in a line out during the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool D match at the City of Toyota Stadium in Toyota City on 23 September 2019. SPONSORED The action continues at the Rugby World Cup on Thursday with a Pool D clash between Georgia and Fiji. At this stage of the tournament, Georgia have a better looking record having won one, earning a bonus point in the process and lost one but it is Fiji, rooted to the bottom of the table, who are expected to come out tops. Fiji bumped Australia in the opener and then went down narrowly to Uruguay. Georgia were thumped by Wales and then thumped Uruguay. But the betting has Fiji as 3/10 favourites ahead of the 3/1 offered on the chances of the Georgians as far as the Full Time Result is concerned. This probably has something to do with the history between the two sides. Georgia have only managed to win once in the three encounters involving these two. Fiji were victorious when they met in 2012 and again last year when running out 37-15 victors. Georgia won a low-scoring encounter 14-3 in 2016. The Handicap sees Georgia (+8.5) vs Fiji (-8.5) is at 9/10 while Georgia (+7.5) vs Fiji (-9.5) is at evens. The Half Time / Full Time market sees Fiji at 13/20 to win both halves and there’s 33/10 on Georgia doing the same. There’s 11/2 on Georgia leading at the break but Fiji coming from behind and 14/1 on Fiji to lead at half time before Georgia take control at the final whistle. You can take 9/20 on Fiji or 19/10 Georgia as far as the Half Time Result is concerned. There’s 8/10 on Fiji leading after 20 minutes or 19/10 on Georgia being ahead at that point of the match. If you enjoy playing the various tryscorer markets then you can get 5/10 on a backline player scoring the first try of the match and 15/10 on a forward. There’s 100/1 on no first try being scored. There’s 21/20 on offer for a lineout to be the first stoppage in play and you can take 5/2 on the first whistle being blown for a penalty or free kick. The same price is available for a scrum to be the first break in play or there’s 22/1 for a try. This might turn out to be an entertaining encounter given that both sides are effectively playing for pride with the pool looking like it has already been decided.
