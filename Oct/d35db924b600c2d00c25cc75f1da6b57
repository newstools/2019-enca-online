WATCH: Let's look at land reform process in a positive way: Ramaphosa “Beyond the 56, we have over 190 farms...it's the first phase of the three phases that we'll be running. We've got other pieces of land that we are going to be making available, very soon we will be announcing the strategic land parcels that are going to be given for large scale development in the city and those that are qualifying will access those, including the people who are sitting in the township.” Masina said the Gauteng government has a “huge land disposal programme.”
