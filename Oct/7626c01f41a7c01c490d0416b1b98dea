His friends were planning a huge birthday celebration for his 19th birthday next month but his life was cut short last Saturday night, when he was stabbed to death in a robbery at Clifton’s 3rd Beach. “It’s very sad, it’s not good to send your child at school at the end of the day you coming back with the body. It’s not good,” said Mbatha’s father, Lindo Mbatha.
