I had to take that step. It wasn’t easy; I had a lot of conversations even with my brother. “By the time I had sent the letter, I had made peace with what could come with me sending the letter to the minister.” Many have applauded Ndara’s bravery in speaking out. READ: Letitia Wright named highest-earning actor of 2018 Veteran actress Florence Masebe has expressed support for Ndara. “We never for a second thought that things have improved but you want to believe in your heart of hearts that somebody at Vatiswa’s level is not finding themselves still being this frustrated,” Masebe said. “It takes a lot in this industry for one to find the strength to speak up. It must have taken a lot for her to write all these details so publicly, putting herself out there. A lot of it makes sense because we are still desperately trying to convince people we are three times more than they think we are worth. “It is not just the producers, it is broadcasters themselves who when deciding on budgets, have decided that things can be done with very little reserved for the talent.” Those are the questions we should ask more ofter when enjoying the small screen.
