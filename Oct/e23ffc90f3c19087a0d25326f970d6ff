 YOKAHAMA - Six Nations champions Wales lock horns with southern hemisphere kings South Africa on Sunday as they bid to reach their first Rugby World Cup final at coach Warren Gatland's send-off tournament. Injuries have not been kind to the Welsh but they have enjoyed a hold over South Africa in recent times, winning their last four Tests against the Rugby Championship title-holders. However, they are yet to beat the Springboks at the World Cup, after losing to them in the pool stage in 2011 and again in the 2015 quarter-finals, where Fourie du Preez snatched victory with a last-gasp try. The winner of Sunday's semi-final in Yokohama will face Eddie Jones's England, who stunned two-time defending champions New Zealand 19-7 on Saturday to halt their 18-match winning streak in the competition. The fresher, powerful Springboks are arguably the favourites against Wales, as they look to cap a turnaround under coach Rassie Erasmus by winning their third world title. Captain Siya Kolisi is in no doubt about the value of a World Cup win in helping to close the country's divisions. "I have seen what winning a World Cup does for our country," said Kolisi, who was 16 when South Africa last lifted the trophy in 2007. "I am old enough to remember the 2007 World Cup and I remember what it did for the country then and I know what it will do for the country now."
