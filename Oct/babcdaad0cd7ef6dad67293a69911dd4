JOHANNESBURG - A group of 15 troubled young boys spent a day in Atteridgeville prison to remind them to keep on the straight and narrow. It's part of an initiative by the Correctional Services Department and Sithuthukisa Bonke Crisis Centre. They hope this will raise awareness about substance abuse and assist with crime prevention. READ: Drugs, money and beer found in Durban prison raid The 15 boys got a taste of what it's like to be behind bars. They were picked because of their involvement in drugs and for often running into trouble with teachers. "Correctional services are not really nice places to be," said Correctional Services regional commissioner Thakane Molatedi. "Losing one’s freedom – I think that is one thing we want them to experience." It's hoped this visit will serve as a wake-up call of what could happen if these children continue along this path, one often chosen because of peer pressure.
