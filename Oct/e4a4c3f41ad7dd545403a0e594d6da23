Zuma says Madonsela didn't give him a right of reply to allegations made against him.

So what does the public do now, instead of focusing on state capture, the public narrative is diverted into ‘was Mr. Zuma treated badly?’. READ: Day two of Duduzane Zuma state capture testimony Madonsela says the state capture is an opportunity for Zuma to tell his side of the story and it is not about whether he was treated properly or not. “You should see the commission as a continuum from the public protector. It is sort of a relay, we have handed over the baton to the commission,” she said.
