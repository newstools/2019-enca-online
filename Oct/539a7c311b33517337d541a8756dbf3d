The city has now come up with a novel way to deter errant drivers by donating their impounded phones. WATCH: You could be in deep water for swearing at Cape Town beaches Texting while driving is named as one of the causes of road fatalities. “We have now in the new bylaw, we will have a provision that will allow us to donate these phones to neighborhood watch members, in which we have many across the City. Good people putting in a lot of time and energy. And what we don’t donate to the neighborhood watch, we can give to NGO’s or other public benefit organisations,” said Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. Motorists say they are not sure about this strategy.
