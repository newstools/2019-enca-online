Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs' bid to end a lengthy trophy draught resumes on Saturday when they start their Telkom Knockout campaign against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium. The Telkom Knockout will be Amakhosi’s first cup tournament after missing out on the MTN 8. Chiefs have already played City in a league match this season, winning the game 2-1 in Cape Town. READ: Tough draw for Kaizer Chiefs in TKO last 16 With a positive start to the Absa premiership season, the Soweto giants find themselves top of the league table after eight matches. However, coach Ernst Middendorp and his charges want to take each game as it comes without too much pressure. "We haven't really put ourselves into a pressure situation to say ok now this cup or that cup. We are really preparing ourselves for each and every game independent to the cup game Telkom Cup or PSL or a test game we are not making any difference we will do everything to go into the next round and that's our target,” Middendorp said. Goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and Joseph Molangoane  are expected to miss the TKO opener due to injury.
