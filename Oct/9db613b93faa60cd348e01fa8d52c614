JOHANNESBURG - South Africa was hit by power cuts on Wednesday after a number of Eskom generating units broke down, highlighting the challenge facing President Cyril Ramaphosa in rescuing the state power firm. Eskom said it would cut 2,000 megawatts (MW) of power until 11pm on a rotational basis across the country, the first power cuts in around seven months. Johannesburg residents, who have grown used to frequent power outages over the past decade, expressed renewed frustration about the impact on their lives.

"We make money out of this business through electricity; if it's not there then we are going down." Eric Gyimah, a media consultant, said the power cuts were a "huge inconvenience". Eskom said close to a quarter of its roughly 45,000 MW capacity was offline on Wednesday because of unplanned breakdowns and faults including boiler tube leaks and broken a conveyer belt for coal.
