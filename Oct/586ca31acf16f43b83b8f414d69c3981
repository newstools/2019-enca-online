Zuma faces corruption and racketeering charges. It's not yet clear if the former president will appeal the court's decision. Public Interest Founder, Tebogo Khaas says a trial against Zuma would serve as an affirmation of democracy. “It will certainly do a lot in improving the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system but that shouldn’t be a flash in the pan,” Khaas said. “There is still a long way to go and it will be too premature to celebrate anything. There is still a need to overhaul the system itself.” WATCH: Zuma's application dismissed with costs However, political analyst Prince Mashele predicts Zuma will pull all the stops to block his corruption case. “My sense is that he will appeal the judgment because that has been his strategy,” Mashele said. “Jacob Zuma’s strategy is to buy time. When this case began, he was a 60-something-year-old man, now he is a 70-something-year-old man. If he were to delay this case by a decade, he will be an 80-something-year-old man. His strategy is to delay this thing so that eventually even if he gets convicted he will be too old or close to the grave.” Former president Jacob Zuma's corruption trial begins at the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg.
