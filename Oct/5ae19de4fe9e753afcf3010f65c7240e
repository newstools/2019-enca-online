Rand Water is moving to stage two water restrictions to prevent Day Zero. The water supplier says residents are over-using water, READ: Joburg residents urged to use water sparingly But Johannesburg Water says there's more to this story, claiming that the restrictions are there to save the supplier. "You will recall that Rand Water had problems with one of their reservoirs," said Johannesburg Water spokesperson Isaac Dhludhlu. "That, in essence, set them at the back foot in terms of provision of water capacity on their side or being able to build capacity on their side so that is affecting supply."

"The consumers will start to see the reduced flow or the reduced pressure," said Rand Water's executive manager for operations, Eddie Singo. Johannesburg Water is asking residents to keep a lookout for its water trucks should they find themselves without water.
