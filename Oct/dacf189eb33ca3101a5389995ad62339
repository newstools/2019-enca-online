Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie (South Africa Teachers' Union) union is questioning the inclusion of sex education from as early as Grade 4. Some teachers are concerned about plans to teach young children about sex. "We are fully aware of the realities that children are molested, that they are sexually exploited and we are aware of the fact that schools have a role to play in this regard, to teach children and strengthen their knowledge and protect them against any abuse. But the lesson plans go much further than just to inform children about the dangers of molestation and sexual abuse, in fact it promotes a particular sexual lifestyle and we have a serious problem with that", said the union's CEO, Chris Klopper.

"Let's say one of the lessons is that a teacher has to explain or describe to children what the effects of vaginal sex would be, anal sex would be, masturbation and we think teachers would be extremely uncomfortable teaching that," he said.
