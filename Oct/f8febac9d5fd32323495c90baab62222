JOHANNESBURG - World-renowned DJ Black Coffee, real name Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo, made a special appearance on "The Daily Show" with Trevor Noah. During the interview, Noah asked Maphumalo why he thinks he has managed to receive so much international recognition. "It's resilience, it's knowing hunger and knowing that you've experienced it and you don't wanna go back there, that is what has kept me going and that's what has gotten me to where I am today," said Maphumulo.

"We are trying to change the narrative about the continent where, maybe it is our fault, we have always seen Africa as an inferior place. All the best things were seen on TV, which means they were here in America or in Europe. It took so much from the continent and we are trying to reverse that", added Maphumulo. Over the weekend, Black Coffee also shared a picture with American rapper Drake following his performance at a Toronto nightclub.
