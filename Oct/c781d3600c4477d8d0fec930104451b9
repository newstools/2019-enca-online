Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Our trains are not safe. This is according to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula is promising to fix the rail system to make it safe and run on time. He says South Africans will be able to see positive changes within the next six months. “They are not safe. We are working towards ensuring that they are safe, reliable and on time,” Mbalula said. READ: Mbalula has grand plan for transport The minister says a war room has been set up to deal with issues of safety and faulty signals so that South Africans can enjoy affordable, reliable and safe transport. “In less than six months you will see changes on the trains in terms of security that we will be bringing in. It will take a longer period for other corridors like Cape Town Main Line. It’s a big headache,” Mbalula said.
Mbalula says safety and the torching of trains is a major concern but he did not hold back when saying who he thought was behind the arson and stealing of cables. “Those with vested interests could be behind this because they stand to gain.... if you burn trains you would need security. It causes demand,” he said. Mbalula said from now on, security will be done in-house and people will be trained by SAPS.
