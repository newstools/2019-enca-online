George Coetzee played the front nine in five-under, while a bogey on the penultimate green was his only blemish. PARIS - South African George Coetzee and New Zealand's Ryan Fox claimed a share of the lead after the first round of the French Open on Thursday as the European Tour returned to Le Golf National a year after it hosted the Ryder Cup. The leading duo fired six-under-par rounds of 65 to edge ahead on a kind day for scoring, with world number 128 Fox missing a good birdie chance on the final green as darkness started to close in. Defending champion Alex Noren is the highest-ranked player in the field at 53rd and the only man who also featured in the Ryder Cup, so organisers will be relieved that the event will be returning to its regular slot next year, albeit reportedly in southern France rather than the Paris suburbs. The 33-year-old Coetzee played the front nine in five-under, while a bogey on the penultimate green was his only blemish.

He has since slipped to his current mark of 289. "It's nice to be in the mix again. It's been kind of a hard, long year, but feels like the game is coming along nicely," the four-time European Tour winner said, after taking advantage of the early conditions, despite the morning gloom. "It was weird. It was weird playing in the dark. I felt if I was a cricketer, they would have called it off. "The course is in amazing nick. Dark and light doesn't really make a difference when the course is as good as it is."
