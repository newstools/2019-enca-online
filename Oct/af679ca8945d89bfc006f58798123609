Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The race to become the Democratic Alliance's next leader has officially begun. Just a day after being nominated unopposed as the new Parliamentary leader, John Steenhuisen has become the first to say he wants to become the party's interim leader. And, ultimately, its federal leader in 2020. WILD: Steenhuisen has a mammoth task to quell race claims in DA Steenhuisen’s announcement comes less than a week after the resignation of Mmusi Maimane. The DA will elect an interim leader and an interim federal chairperson next month. “I want to chart a new way forward for the DA. No matter how hard and trying things may seem at the moment because I believe in the end I draw my strength and inspiration from the incredible people of this wonderful organisation,” Steenhuisen said. “The project is bigger than individuals, there’s work to be done, building that non-racial alternative, and I look forward playing a role in shaping it.”
