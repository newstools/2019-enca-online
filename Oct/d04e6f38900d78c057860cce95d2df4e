Daniel Cardoso of Kaizer Chiefs challenged by Sibusiso Sibeko of Golden Arrows during the Absa Premiership match on the 01 October 2019 at FNB Stadium. JOHANNESBURG -Â German coach Ernst Middendorp and Slovak counterpart Jozef Vukusic guided Kaizer Chiefs and AmaZulu to victories on Tuesday at opposite ends of the Absa Premiership. League pacesetters Chiefs stretched their lead to four points by defeating Golden Arrows 2-0 on an unseasonally chilly spring night in Soweto through a penalty and an own goal. AmaZulu ended a seven-match winless run since the season began by snatching a 2-1 stoppage-time victory over Cape Town City in Durban. The dramatic triumphed lifted AmaZulu off the bottom to 14th place after Vukusic had lost his first two matches since replacing the sacked Cavin Johnson.
