Wondo said, "we take the contamination very serious hence minimising the products from the owners, they mustn't release, it's important to start with healthcare providers that they know and substitute, there is a lot of products in that range, on the patients side we will request they must go back to their healthcare workers to substitute."
The regulatory authority is in touch with suppliers of ranitidine-containing medicines, and wants an investigation and it will keep the public posted.
