Everything touches them and you kind of ask yourself why because if you’re so comfortable within yourself, why do you have to impose yourself on other people? That’s why we’re in such a violent space in terms of gender”, said Umlilo. He said he is glad the publication finally caught up to evolving notions around sexuality and identity.
