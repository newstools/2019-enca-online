A whopping 75 percent of South Africa's foreign direct investment comes from the EU. Kionka, who was speaking at the annual SA Europe CEO dialogue, meant to facilitate business deals says it's important the economic bloc raise concerns about certain government policies. "Whether in the form of broad-based black economic empowerment and public procurement policies which we fully support but which must be better tailored in how they are implemented so that they can reach their aim without hampering foreign investment," Mboweni said.
