Wales team group ahead of the Rugby World Cup Pool D match between Australia 25-29 Wales at Tokyo Stadium in Chofu, Tokyo, Japan. SPONSORED Fiji’s Rugby World Cup campaign comes to an end at Oita Stadium on Wednesday. A win over Wales would mean that they would still, in theory, be alive in the tournament but that would be short-lived with Wales having a game in hand and rounding off their group stage campaign against Uruguay this weekend. The realistic scenario though is that Wales continue their march towards an unbeaten run into the quarter-finals with two wins on the bounce. Their price of 1/9 justifies the thinking when it comes to the full time result while Fiji are 7/1. The Handicap has Wales (-16.5) vs Fiji (+16.5) at 9/10 and Wales (-17.5) vs Fiji (+15.5) is at even money. The Half Time Result has Wales 3/10 and Fiji at 28/10. You can get 4/1 on Fiji being ahead at half time but Wales in front at the end as opposed to the 7/20 on Wales to be ahead at both whistles. If you enjoy speculating on the Winning Margin then there is 6/10 on Wales over 12.5 while Wales under 12.5 is at 21/10. Fiji under 12.5 is quoted at 17/2. The 28/10 on Wales 11-20 is at the top of the boards as far as the Alternative Winning Margin is concerned while Wales 1-10 is at 3/1. Wales 21-30 is at 7/2 and Wales 31-40 is at 11/2. In 11 meetings between these sides, Wales have won nine, drawn one and suffered a solitary loss, at the World Cup in 2007. Amazingly, this will be the fourth time in as many tournaments that these teams have met in the same pool. In their last encounter at the 2015 edition, Wales won 23-13 at the Millennium Stadium. The Exact Winning Margin has Wales, who should end top of Pool D after their brave win over Australia, by 30+ at 28/10 with a wide gap to the next offer, the 16/1 on Wales by 16 points. The Winning Margin Spread has Wales 6-10, Wales 11-15, Wales 16-20 and Wales 21-25 at 11/2 at the top of the boards while Wales 1-5 and Wales 26-30 is quoted at sevens. Wales 31-35 is at 9/1.
