JOHANNESBURG - The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture will on Tuesday hear testimony about  Eskom's sponsoring of TNA breakfast briefings. Acting General Manager: Strategic Marketing and Branding of Eskom, Pieter Pretorius and former Divisional Executive: Corporate Affairs at the power utility, Chose Choeu, are expected to take the stand. In 2014, the Mail and Guardian reported that the then Eskom interim CEO Collin Matjila stirred controversy at the power utility over a R43-million contract to sponsor The New Age's (TNA) breakfast briefings. The contract committed the cash-strapped power utility to sponsor around one TNA breakfast briefing per month for three years, the newspaper's AmaBhungane investigative unit reported. The contract apparently overshot Eskom's sponsorship budget and allegedly did not contain an exit clause, which the parastatal's lawyers allegedly raised concerns about prior to Matjila's approval of the contract.
