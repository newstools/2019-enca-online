File: Japan's Asaeli Ai Valu in action against South Africa at the Kumagaya Rugby Stadium on 06 September 2019. SPONSORED It’s do or die for Scotland on Sunday as they must win against Japan in order to ensure that they can continue to the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup. Had it not been for a brave win over Ireland, Japan may have been ruled out of contention to progress but instead, it blew Pool A wide open as suddenly three sides came into the reckoning. There’s very little to split the sides as far as their World Rankings go with Japan only marginally ahead of Scotland. They’re ranked eighth and ninth respectively. Scotland is favoured at 8/11 to ensure their survival at the competition while Japan, who will have a fervent crowd being them in Yokohama, are at 14/10. The Handicap has Japan (+2.5) vs Scotland (2.5) at 9/10 and Japan (+1.5) vs Scotland (-3.5) at evens. It’s expected to be close and this is reflected in the fact that you can get 14/10 on Scotland Under 12.5 or Japan Under 12.5 in the Winning Margin offer. There’s 33/10 if Scotland goes over 12.5 points while 6/1 is available on Japan over 12.5. The Winning Margin Spread has Scotland 1-5 at 4/1 and Japan 1-5 or Scotland 6-10 at 9/2. Japan 6-10 is at 6/1. Scotland 11-15 is at 13/2 if you feel that they might do it a bit more comfortably. History is firmly on the side of the Scots as they’ve beaten Japan every single time they have met them. The one noticeable difference is that the scoreline is now a lot tighter incredibly tighter. When you compare that Scotland managed to post 100 points in a game back in 2004 to the fact that there were just five points in it in their previous encounter in 2016 there is no denying that Japan has made massive strides in improving the brand of rugby they play and they’ve proved it now in consecutive Rugby World Cup tournaments. Circumstances were very different the last time these two teams met in the World Cup with Scotland claiming a comfortable 45-10 win in Gloucester in 2015. How the pressure of having to win to survive in the tournament affects them remains to be seen here. The organisers couldn’t have asked for a better fixture to round off the group stages of the tournament with. For a full range of betting options available on this match then click here.
