Dumisani Mkhwanazi, the man accused of killing the University of Johannesburg student is expected to appear in court on Monday, more than 6-years after she disappeared, having visited friends in Phiri, Soweto. Madiba’s remains were discovered more than two-years later, in a shallow grave in the backyard of the friends' home. Mkhwanazi, the friend's uncle, was finally arrested earlier this year.

For Madiba’s family - the pain hasn't eased. “That is why you never want to go there. It’s like you live on the surface,” said Madiba’s aunt, Malesela Moshidi. Madiba’s family strongly believes that her friend and family have known what happened all along. The family still wishes it had been allowed to see their rose grow, into the independent woman she dreamed of.
