Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Minerals and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe is in hot water. There are growing calls that he be investigated on multiple fronts for reportedly admitting to bribing two Sunday World journalists. The paper's quoting him as confessing to paying R70,000 to stop a story about an alleged affair he had. READ: Mantashe criticises Mboweni's recovery plan “As editor I have a duty to call him and say who are these people because if these people are in this newsroom, I have a responsibility to ensure they suffer the consequences of their actions,” said Sunday World editor, Makhudu Sefara. The paper is now trying to establish who these journalists are. The South African National Editors Forum wants Mantashe to appear before a media ethics inquiry to account for his actions. “We want the minister to explain himself to this commission on why he decided to pay journalists, which is of course a criminal offence,” said Sanef treasurer, Adriaan Basson. Mantashe will now face more heat in Parliament, where the DA has laid a complaint against him.
