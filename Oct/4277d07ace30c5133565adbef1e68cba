British police forensics officers work on a lorry found to be containing 39 dead bodies. LONDON - British police investigating the discovery of 39 bodies in a truck said they had arrested three more people as a security source in Hanoi said some of the victims could be Vietnamese. The horrific case has shocked Britain and turned the spotlight onto the dangers of human trafficking. Police initially believed the victims were all Chinese nationals, but said that the "picture may change" on identification. A Vietnamese man told AFP he feared his sister, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, was among the dead and said she had sent a heart-wrenching message to their mother before her death.

Her brother confirmed to AFP the text message was authentic. Essex deputy chief constable Pippa Mills said police would not be "speculating" on the nationalities of the victims, calling it a "developing picture".

After detaining the truck driver at the scene -- a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland -- on suspicion of murder, Essex police confirmed three additional arrests on Friday. The first autopsies were to take place on Friday as investigators attempt to establish how they died before the work begins on trying to identify the victims. The police investigation is Britain's largest murder probe since the 2005 London suicide bombings.
