Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Lobby group, the Coalition against Sanctions, says sanctions against Zimbabwe are hurting the people and not the politicians. The coalition, flanked by the ANC and PAC, have handed over memorandums of demand to the United States and European Union embassies, demanding an end to sanctions. The organisation says the measures are unjust and punishing the population. The sanctions are targeting 85 people, including Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa and 56 businesses, which are seen as crucial to Zimbabwe’s economy. "Here is what we are saying I am just a citizen with a mother in Zimbabwe crying with no food in the stomach, because our government is saying sanctions are the cause right now we know that there is mismanagement, there is corruption a lot of things that can be said to the government of Zimbabwe," said Coalition against Sanctions director Wellington Manyonda.
