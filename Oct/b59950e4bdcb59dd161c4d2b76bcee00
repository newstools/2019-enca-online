Jailed #FeesMustFall activist Kanya Cekeshe has been denied leave to appeal his sentence and conviction. JOHANNESBURG - Kanya Cekeshe has been denied leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. Bail has also been denied. Magistrate Theunis Carstens said Cekeshe acknowledged that he knew the charges and their consequences in his guilty plea statement. "He said he knew his actions are wrongful and punishable by law,” said Carstens. Carstens said it's not in the interest of justice to release Cekeshe on bail. Earlier, former #FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini said the state's case against Cekeshe is a miscarriage of justice. "We have always been saying that the state has never had a case on students. It's a tragedy, it's sad actually," said Dlamini.
