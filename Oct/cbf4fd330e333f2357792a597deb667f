A Langebaan community leader is accusing police and the South African Rugby Union of turning a blind eye to racism. #DStv403 HOPEFIELD - Four people want more than a million rand from Springbok Eben Etzebeth. READ: Etzebeth remains in Japan amid racial abuse claims They say he hurled racial abuse at them, and have officially instituted legal proceedings against him in the equality court following an alleged incident in the Western Cape coastal town of Langebaan in August. While South Africans were celebrating a crucial win against Italy, four people from Langebaan were laying charges of hate speech against Springbok lock, Eben Etzebeth. The South African Human Rights Commission filed the complaint on behalf of the four, in the Hopefield Magistrate's Court. Enver Wilsnach, Yorayda Papier, Mogamad Smith and Kay Lee Brook claim in court papers that Etzebeth called them the H-word, a derogatory term for coloured people. They say this happened outside the Watergat restaurant in Langebaan on 25 August.
SAHRC spokesperson, Buang Jones said, "the equality court will now give Mr Etzebeth and his lawyers an opportunity to file an answering affidavit. Following the receipt of the affidavit, the magistrate will set down the matter for directions hearing." The complainants and Etzebeth will be required to attend this hearing. The four have been advised not to speak to the media for fear of jeopardising their case. The Langebaan four are seeking damages of over R1-million. They also want him to do community service, and attend an anger management course. At a community meeting, residents spoke of racism still being rife in their town. They want Etzebeth to apologise publicly to the coloured community. Etzebeth has denied all allegations against him.
