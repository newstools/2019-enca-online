The ailing Newcastle municipality is adjusting its budget to try service its ballooning Eskom debt but this is likely to come at a cost to other services. Ntuthuko Mahlaba, the Newcastle mayor said, "what caused a delay was that we had to go through budget adjustments and try to cut certain things from the budget to make sure that we have an affordable payment plan." Residents and business owners are concerned.

"That's why you find that most of the business are retrenching to try and meet the utility bills." "At the rate that we are going most businesses will be shutting down in Newcastle, hoping that something happens quickly before this town becomes a ghost town."
Eskom declined to comment, saying the matter is before the court. Both parties are due back in court on Thursday.
