New Zealand's number 8 Kieran Read (front) walks with his team. SPONSORED It’s the game that nobody wants to play in. The match of the Rugby World Cup that serves as a reminder that a team was so near but also so far. The play-off for third and fourth place at the Rugby World Cup takes place on Friday with New Zealand running out to do battle with Wales. For the team’s involved it must be a hard game to get excited about. On this occasion, one gets the feeling that New Zealand will have a point to prove so it could be a case of heaven help the Welsh from what might be a barrage. There can be no denying that the All Blacks had no answer in their semifinal clash against England last weekend. It’s been a very long time since any team has turned in a performance like that against Steve Hansen’s men. That is the other reason why it might be messy for Wales. Steve Hansen hands control of New Zealand rugby to a successor after this. His side will be giving him a proper send off. As far as the betting markets are concerned, New Zealand are 1/10 for the clash with Wales given at 8/1. The Handicap has New Zealand (-18.5) vs Wales (+18.5) at 9/10 and New Zealand (-19.5) vs Wales (+17.5) at evens.
