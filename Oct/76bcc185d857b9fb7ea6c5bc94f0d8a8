JOHANNESBURG - Ivan van Rooyen was named coach of Super Rugby side the Golden Lions on Wednesday and tasked with reviving the fortunes of the Johannesburg club. The 37-year-old succeeds Swys de Bruin, a more experienced coach than Van Rooyen who quit this month after suffering a stress-related illness. "We have the opportunity to create something very special. We have a young but dynamic team and a blank canvas," Van Rooyen said in a statement.  After reaching three consecutive finals of the southern hemisphere competition from 2016, the Lions lost eight of 16 matches this year and failed to qualify for the play-offs.

Van Rooyen will have to do without two Springboks, hooker Malcolm Marx and loose forward Kwagga Smith, next season as they have signed short-term contracts with Japanese clubs. Van Rooyen has risen through the ranks during 10 years at the Lions, starting as coach of age-limit teams and working as the conditioning coach before assisting De Bruin. The Lions launch their 2020 Super Rugby campaign away to the Argentine Jaguares on February 1 followed by a home fixture against the Queensland Reds from Australia the following weekend.
