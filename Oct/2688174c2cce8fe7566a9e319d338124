File: The new gender-neutral emojis differ slightly from the male and female ones. SAN FRANCISCO - Apple has put out new gender-neutral emojis of most of its people icons -- including punks, clowns and zombies -- as part of an update to its mobile operating system. The tech giant has offered growing numbers of inclusive emoji designs in recent years, putting out a range of skin tones and occupations, with Google's Android publishing its own non-binary faces in May. A wheelchair, guide dog and a flexing prosthetic arm are among Apple's latest batch -- put out on Monday with the iOS 13.2 upgrade -- that users can slip into messages to get their points across. The new gender-neutral emojis differ slightly from the male and female ones. READ: Emoji are becoming more inclusive, but not necessarily more representative In some, the style and colour of their clothes is changed. In others the haircuts are different and a "gender-neutral facial structure" is used, says the Emojipedia website. The attempt at on-screen inclusivity has not pleased everyone however, with some suggesting the icons indicate how gender-nonconforming people should look. When it unveiled the designs earlier this year, Apple said they would "bring even more diversity to the keyboard" and "fill a significant gap" in the selection of emojis. "Users will now be able to select any combination of skin tone, in addition to gender," it said.
