Themba Zwane of Mamelodi Sundowns during the MTN8 2019 semifinal second leg match between Mamelodi Sundowns and Supersport United at the Lucas Moripe Stadium, Atteridgeville on the 18 September 2019. JOHANNESBURG - Themba Zwane scored to set up Mamelodi Sundowns for a 2-1 victory at Black Leopards Wednesday, and third place in the Absa Premiership. Zwane prodded a cross from Venezuelan Jose Ali Meza past Guinea-Bissau goalkeeper Jose Mendes on 25 minutes at a packed Thohoyandou stadium in the northeast of the republic. A mix-up with Mendes condemned Leopards' Namibian Chris Katjiukua to concede an own-goal just before half-time as the side played under Belgian coach Luc Eymael for the first time. Eymael, who arrived from a club post in Egypt after previously coaching two South African sides, replaced Frenchman Lionel Soccoia following a poor start to the 2019/2020 season. Zambian Mwape Musonda, the leading Premiership scorer last season with 16 goals, halved the deficit on 59 minutes and Sundowns survived some anxious moments before winning.

Sundowns' victory came five days after they smashed two CAF Champions League records when overwhelming Cote d'Or of the Seychelles 11-1 in a qualifier ahead of the group phase. Promoted Stellenbosch won for the first time as goals from Waseem Isaacs and Iqraam Rayners within 20 minutes of the kick-off produced a shock 2-0 win at fourth-place Polokwane City. After going five league games without a victory since the season began, Maritzburg United won for the second time in six days by edging Baroka 1-0 through a Mxolisi Kunene goal.
