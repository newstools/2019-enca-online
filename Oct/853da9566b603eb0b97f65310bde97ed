TOKYO - Rassie Erasmus confirmed he would be stepping down as Springbok head coach after Saturday’s World Cup final against England in Yokohama. READ: Erasmus dismisses racism claims in Boks squad Erasmus confirmed on Thursday in a media briefing that he will be stepping down as head coach at the end of this year and that the 2019 World Cup final will be his last game coaching the team. "It is probably my last Test -- it is my last test match that I will be the head coach," he said after naming his side for Saturday's final. Erasmus only took over the Springboks last year, but has transformed the side that failed to shine under Allister Coetzee, who was sacked after managing just 11 wins in his 25 games in charge. The Boks' turnaround has seen them lose only once in 11 Tests in 2019, during which they claimed the Rugby Championship for the first time since 2009 and climb back into the top two of the World Rugby rankings for the first time since August 2015. - Additional reporting AFP
