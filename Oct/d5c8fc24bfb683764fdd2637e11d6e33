Analyst Prince Mashele speaks to Shahan Ramkissoon shortly after the DA's Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip announced their resignations. JOHANNESBURG - With three prominent resignations from the Democratic Alliance in less than a week, at least one political analyst is questioning whether the party will retain it's black followers. On Monday, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba announced his resignation from the DA, following Helen Zille's appointment as Chairperson of the party's Federal Council. "I can't be a willing participant, in good conscience, in a process that is placed in the narrow internal, interests of a political party ahead of the needs of the five million residents of the city of Johannesburg." His resignation was followed by that of DA leader Mmusi Maimane and Federal Chairperson Athol Trollip on Wednesday. "I fundamentally believed that if the DA was to become a party of government, it needed to look and feel like a party for all, not some. It needed to belong to all South Africans." Analyst Prince Mashele says the Democratic Alliance, as a multiracial party in South Africa, has died. "The strategy on the part of the Institute of Race Relations and Helen Zille, and the group that has pushed Mmusi down the cliff, is that they want to become a Volkstaad party that governs the Western Cape. They don't care what happens to the rest of South Africa." He says the DA is going back to its original self that only focuses on the interests of white people. Mashele says he won't be surprised if the party sees black people leaving. "Why would any sane black person remain in such a  party? I expect an exodus of black members and leaders ..."
