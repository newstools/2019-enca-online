JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in Johannesburg says it’s not surprised by mayor Herman Mashaba’s decision to resign. Mashaba announced his resignation as a member of the DA and as mayor on Monday. He will vacate his office on 27 November. READ: Mashaba confirms resignation from DA The ANC says Mashaba is using Helen Zille's election as DA Federal Council chairperson as an excuse to escape explaining the city's dire financial state. "The ANC is not surprised or shocked by the decision to resign we did expect it," said ANC Johannesburg regional secretary Dada Morero. The ANC claims that other than the DA's internal squabbles, Mashaba's resignation is also more about the financial position of the city.
