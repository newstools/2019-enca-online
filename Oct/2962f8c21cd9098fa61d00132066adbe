File: Doctor Melvin Naidu died outside the hotel room, bleeding from a stab wound. DURBAN - A woman initially linked to the death of a Durban surgeon is off the hook, for now. Doctor Melvin Naidu and the woman were at the upmarket Capital Pearls hotel in Umhlanga on Thursday when an altercation broke out. He died outside their room, bleeding from a stab wound. His companion was arrested for his murder and spent the weekend behind bars. Her lawyer has managed to have her released from custody shortly before she was scheduled to appear in court for the first time. “She claims she was attacked and acted in self-defence," said Ravindra Maniklall. "The State has decided not to enroll the case, meaning that they do not have sufficient information to start a prosecution at this point in time.”
