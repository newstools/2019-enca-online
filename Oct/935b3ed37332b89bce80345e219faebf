The exhibition titled Painful Memories and Bitter Tears honours the late anti-apartheid activist Timol. He was detained in a roadblock in 1971 and days later apartheid police claimed he'd jumped to his death. He died in 1971 after falling from the 10th floor of what was known then as the John Vorster Square Police Station. The Timol family says Freedom Park is an iconic place to honour our heroes. They have said the exhibition represents thousands of other freedom fighters who remain voiceless in a democratic South Africa. WATCH: Apartheid officer in Ahmed Timol's death granted bail “The exhibition forms part of many initiatives to preserve the legacy of my beloved uncle Ahmed Timol. This is a powerful weapon and grim reminder of our past,” said Timol's nephew, Imtiaz Cajee. The family waited for more than 40 years for a court to rule that Timol was murdered and did not commit suicide. Former apartheid policeman, Joao Rodrigues, who is now retired, stands accused of murder. “On the 12 December, the judge will hopefully give us a bit more details the case will commence," added Cajee. The Freedom Park says it's honoured to host the exhibition, which will continue until November the 30th.
