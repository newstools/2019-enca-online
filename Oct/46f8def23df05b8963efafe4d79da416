It is reported that the water in the reservoirs has dipped to below 50%. RUSTENBURG - The Rustenburg municipality is cutting water supplies. It is reported that the water in the reservoirs has dipped to below 50 percent. Residents are likely to go without water for up to 12-hours a day, between 5pm and 5am.  This is a preventative measure taken by the municipality as water levels in the dams begin to drop. David Magae, the Rustenburg local municipality spokesperson said, "We had to put in place measures to ensure we at least prolong the water we have in the system until we have water." "We did not want to wait until the situation worsened because in implementing water restrictions, the system allows us to draw water to store into reservoirs and increase the water levels. " he further explained.
