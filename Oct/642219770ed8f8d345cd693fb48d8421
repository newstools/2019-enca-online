Scotland's centre Chris Harris (C) is tackled during the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A match between Scotland and Samoa at the Kobe Misaki Stadium in Kobe on September 30, 2019. SPONSORED It’s something of a lost cause for Scotland as far as their Rugby World Cup campaign is concerned but they have the opportunity for another good win when they face Russia in Sizuoka Prefecture. It’s a fixture that will likely end in another bruising defeat for the Russians, resigning them to a campaign as the wooden spoon team of Pool A. Scotland are 1/100 for the clash and Russia are 40/1. The Handicap has Scotland (-33.5) vs Russia (+33.5) is at 9/10 with evens on Scotland (-34.5) vs Russia (+32.5). There is 33/10 on Scotland 21-30 or Scotland 31-40 as far as the Alternative Winning Margin goes or you can have 9/2 on Scotland 41-50 if you think that this is going to be a high-scoring encounter. There’s no history between these teams with this the first time they are meeting in an official fixture. But Russia were thumped by Samoa in their first game of the tournament and the Scottish dispatched that opposition with ease when they met last week. The Winning Margin Spread has Scotland 11-20 at 5/1 and Scotland 31-35 and Scotland 36-40 both at 11/2. Scotland 26-30 is quoted at 6/1 with Scotland 41-45 at a tempting 7/1. As expected, the Scotland starting XV dominate the market when it comes to First Tryscorer. Darcy Graham and Tommy Seymour are 11/2 while Blair Kinghorn is 15/2 and Stuart McInally at 9/1. You can get 4/10 on Graham or Seymour to score at any stage of the match while Kinghorn is 6/10 and McInally is at 8/10. For the First Try Converted there is 1/4 on yes and 5/2 for the first conversion to be wide of the mark. In what should be a high-scoring encounter you can get 18/10 on there being a drop goal and 9/10 either way you decide as far as the match total being an odd or even number. As a contest this is not likely to be tightly fought but there is added interest in that Scotland must win with a bonus point to have any hope of sneaking into the playoffs. Anything less and their World Cup will be over even before they run out against Japan on the weekend. For a full list of betting options available on this match then click here.
