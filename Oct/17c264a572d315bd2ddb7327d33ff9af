He says it's a matter for the party to deliberate on. Mabuza was answering a question from the EFF in the National Assembly. READ: Mabuza apologises to nation for load-shedding "Those who donated the money did nothing wrong. It's a clear donation. There's no element of corruption. The money was not stolen, it was donated. It was donated. But the ANC itself as the ruling party which the president represents must define its own policy about fundraising, contesting for positions, that the ANC will do." This comes after Ramaphosa himself was faced with questions in the house in August, when it emerged that Bosasa made contributions to his campaign.
