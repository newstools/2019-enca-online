In honour of the Rugby World Cup, we wanted to share a sportsy video! This is the super super cute moment a baby elephant decides to do some soccer practice using a piece of dung lying around! JOHANNESBURG - An adorable video of a baby elephant playing with a dung ball in the Kruger National Park has gone viral. The video of the elephant was recorded by Dylan Royal, a guide at a lodge during his first morning drive in September. WATCH: There's an elephant on the roof! “We just left & Beyond Tengile in the Sabi sands driving through an area looking for a leopard we heard of from the lodge when we came across a spread-out herd of elephants with quite a few young ones present. "We stopped to watch them for a while and it was not long after we stopped that the smallest calf burst out of the bush, into the road following his soccer ball made of elephant dung," said Royal.
