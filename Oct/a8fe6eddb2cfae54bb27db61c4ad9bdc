The power utility is locked in a bitter court battle with Newcastle Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. The town owes Eskom R213-million amid the threat of power cuts. “It is unacceptable that a national electricity utility should collapse under the weight of the debt,” said Eskom’s lawyer Sydwell Shangisa.

Ratepayers and businesses have joined in the legal fray. The provincial co-operative governance department is concerned about the consequences power cuts would have. “The cutting of electricity to a town the size of Newcastle will result in a human disaster. It will be catastrophic,” said KZN Cogta lawyer Adrian Rall SC. Judgment has been reserved.
