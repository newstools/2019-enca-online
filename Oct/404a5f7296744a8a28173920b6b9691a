We are quite ready, we believe the children are ready and we have invested in them. We must make them proud."

Lesufi says Tshwane is one of the areas where papers were leaked in the past.
 
"Last week Friday myself and students from Tshwane, we signed a pledge that urges all our students to ensure that they don't do or bring things that will compromise the exams." "You will recall that Tshwane was one area two years ago that some of the learners got leaked papers that leaked in Limpopo. The reason why we made this pledge around that area is to reiterate to our children to refrain from participating in activities that will compromise the examination."
