CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance's new Parliamentary Leader John Steenhuisen is calling for those who've left the party to return. Steenhuisen was appointed the party's new Parliamentary leader following Mmusi Maimane's resignation. It has been a bruising week for the DA after its federal council chairperson Athol Trollip also tendered his resignation while eight KZN members left the party to join the ANC. DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille is currently serving as interim leader of the party. READ: DA implosion 'irreversible' Steenhuisen says regardless of the resignation of some of its leaders, the democratic project needs to continue. "It has been a difficult week, we woke up without a leader and a chairperson but we woke up still with 85 seats in parliament, the second biggest party in South Africa, we are in government in a province and a municipality," he said. "We have a duty of care to the people who have put us into these positions to continue building the democratic project. "Leaders come and go, personalities come and go but it is the values and principles of this party that have sustained it in its predecessors through much darker periods in our history."
