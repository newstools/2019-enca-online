"We're going to reinvent it as a musical series, with some of the music of the show, some of the characters. We're going to build out the world of the show that everybody loves... into a big, fun rock 'n' roll musical," he added. "Other ideas are cooking. Grease crosses all kind of genres and, you know, it's hip!" Greenblatt said. "We are in a moment of time where musicals are really back. It's a form that goes in and out of favour, and it's coming back in a big way," he said. "Movie studios are making them, people are going to them. Broadway has never been stronger."
