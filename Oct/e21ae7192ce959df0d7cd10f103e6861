Will the opposition party be able to revive itself as any real threat to the governing party? President of the United Democratic Movement, Bantu Holomisa was in the studio. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President of the United Democratic Movement Bantu Holomisa believes there is more to Mmusi Maimane's resignation from the Democratic Alliance. "We never expected that Mmusi in particular would be treated in the manner he has been by his own party, given the role he has played, being a young fellow but managed to build that political party and bring all nationalities of this country to be under on roof. But politics are politics and I am sure we have not been told the truth as to what could be the reason, why this haste?," said Holomisa. Maimane resigned as leader of the official opposition party on Wednesday. READ: Maimane quits as DA leader His resignation followed that of Herman Mashaba as Johannesburg mayor and from the party. Federal Chairperson of the DA, Athol Trollip, also announced his resignation from the position. Holomisa said despite recent events the role of opposition parties is still important in moving the country forward.

It was the role of the opposition which garnered support and coordinated marches to say the President who was in charge then must go... so you cannot therefore just because of what you see in DA think that the opposition is dead, no don't make a mistake," added Holomisa.
