In 2017, Sorduba Community Tourism submitted a bid for eThekwini to be granted Whale Heritage status.

"The Durban locals didn't even know that we had whales, so we thought that it's a good opportunity to apply for this and because I think the Bluff as a destination can offer quite some good whale experiences," said Sodurba Community Tourism chairperson Helga Du Preez. "We have already received a lot of requests and questions on what can they do, how can they partake and where can they go. So I think with the holiday season coming up we will we get a great deal of tourists." WATCH: PE man nearly swallowed by a whale The Whale Heritage status will benefit the economy and conservation.
