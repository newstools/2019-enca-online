First, questions were raised about his rented house, quickly followed by others about a car he was using, which is said to have been donated by Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste. Now the Institute of Race Relations has joined the fray. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Institute of Race Relations (IRR) is calling for DA leader Mmusi Maimane to resign. Questions have been raised about a house Maimane rented in Cape Town. There’s also claims that the car he was using was donated by former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste. WATCH: Maimane revelations motivated by DA factionalism: expert Analyst and writer at IRR, Hermann Pretorius said with Maimane at the helm, the DA is leaderless. “ He was someone who could take this party from strength to strength and that ability seems now to have either never existed or he has lost that, something has gone wrong. And the party, we can all see it, is leaderless at this point.” Meanwhile, Pretorius, in an opinion piece, called for Western Cape Premier Alan Winde to take over from Maimane. WATCH: Zille joins Institute of Race Relations “The leadership vacuum at the top of the DA and the racial confusion that has seen its once bright prospects tarnish can be addressed in one brave, respectable swoop: by electing Alan Winde as the next leader of the party as soon as possible. By considering the political landscape and the real attitudes of the vast majority of ordinary South Africans and directly challenging the idea that racialism will define our politics, the case for Winde to become DA leader is intriguingly strong,” Pretorius wrote.
