Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance Federal Council chairperson candidate Mike Waters says the party is in crisis. Waters believes the official opposition has strayed from its liberal values. “The core values are liberal values and I believe we have strayed away from those values over the last few years by adopting policies like BEE which is a racist policy, based on race. We have to move away from that to a non-racial program,” Waters said. “I believe members should come to the fore when the party is in crisis and we are in a crisis. “My vision for the party is to go back to its liberal core policies.” WATCH: DA leadership battle intensifies Waters is among four candidates running for the position. Other candidates are Helen Zille, Athol Trollip and Thomas Walters.
