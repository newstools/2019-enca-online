Swollen water levels along Tama river are pictured after heavy rains brought by approaching Typhoon Hagibis hit the Tokyo area on October 12, 2019. Powerful Typhoon Hagibis roared towards Japan's coast on October 12, killing one person and bringing "unprecedented" downpours that prompted authorities to issue their highest-level rain disaster warning. TOKYO, Japan - Rugby World Cup organisers warned Namibia and Canada about the "potential of cancellation" of their final pool game as Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan on Saturday. The governing body has already been forced to cancel two games - England v France and New Zealand v Italy - over the powerful typhoon, which has left one person dead and at least three missing.

It added that a decision on Sunday's match in Kamaishi, a victim of Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster, would be made after an inspection at 6:00am (2100 GMT Saturday).

It would also rob Namibia of a chance to grab their first World Cup win and end their record run of 22 games at the tournament without a victory. Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.
