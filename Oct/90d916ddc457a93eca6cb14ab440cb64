Trevor Noah attends the 50th NAACP Image Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 30, 2019 in Hollywood, California. JOHANNESBURG - Daily Show host Trevor Noah's interview on the US syndicated radio show, Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM, had Twitter buzzing. The South African born comedian spoke to hosts Angela Yee, Charlamagne tha God and DJ Envy - on what he thinks about sexual consent and masculinity. It was his second Breakfast Club interview. Asked about allegations leveled against anchor Matt Lauer by a woman who said she continued sleeping with him after he raped her, Noah said the idea of consent is one that is constantly evolving. "Let's be honest, consent has been something that has been robbed of many individuals in their lives. America fundamentally, I remember a quote where someone said 'America was built on a world of no consent'," he said.

Noah said fundamentally a lot of men struggle with rejection because they tie their identity to a toxic idea about manhood. "While we are talking about consent, we also need to talk about toxic masculinity and the way men see themselves in relation to women. "A lot of the time that is why men are doing what they are doing. Men don't take rejection well because it is tied to their idea of how manly they are and if you think about it, this is the messaging that we got as men."
