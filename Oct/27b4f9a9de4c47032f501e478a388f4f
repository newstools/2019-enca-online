"The speaker has been advised by the SAPS that there's quiet a lot of tensions in relation to this meeting... If any issue is about safety we take advice from the SAPS... The matter has been cancelled. The speaker will sit with the security cluster and pave a way forward," said Mthubanzi Mniki, Nelson Mandela Bay Spkesperson.
