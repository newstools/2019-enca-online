SARS wants to take action agaisnt companies and people who've been avoiding paying taxes. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Services is cleaning up its act, so that it can clean up the act of loaded companies and people who've been avoiding paying taxes. The revenue service has referred some cases for prosecution. SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter is on a mission to rebuild the organisation after years of destruction. Former SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane's tenure at the revenue service saw the dismantling of key units within SARS, one of them being the large business centre. Some say this was intended to help tax dodgers. Kieswetter says SARS now has a unit dedicated to following up on revelations at commissions of inquiry. “Just last week we handed over one matter related to four entities to the new inspectorate within the NPA," he said. "We’ve already done a few tax inquiries and are preparing for a few more.” The tax service has targeted what it calls low hanging fruit, to ramp up collection. The newly launched large business centre will concentrate on companies and individuals with big bucks.

SARS says improving inefficiency will further better tax collection. This year alone, the tax service has registered an extra 875, 000 taxpayers, from which it's collected R2.4-billion.
