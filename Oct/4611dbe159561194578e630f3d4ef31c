Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors’ Forum has received a blow after the Equality Court dismissed its case against the Economic Freedom Fighters. Sanef and five journalists wanted to interdict the party from intimidating, harassing and assaulting journalists. It was over remarks EFF leader Julius Malema made, that were followed by Twitter attacks on the reporters. READ: Sanef has 'descended on political arena': EFF Sanef argued before the Equality Court that Malema's comments stretched beyond fair criticism of the media. But Judge Daisy Molefe has found that being a journalist doesn't qualify for special protection under the Equality Act and that the conduct of the EFF and Malema doesn't amount to hate speech. WATCH: Gordhan, Malema hate speech case showdown Molefe also agreed the party can't be held legally responsible for online comments made about the journalists, even if they were offensive or hurtful. The EFF has welcomed the judgment, again saying that journalists who take sides shouldn't be regarded as journalists. Sanef says it will study the ruling before making any further decisions.
