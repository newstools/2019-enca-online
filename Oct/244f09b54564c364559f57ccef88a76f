Those close to her claim this could be a political smear campaign. WATCH: AFU raids Gumede's Durban property Hawks spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said Gumede was served and cooperated. "Like I said if we talk about immovable properties, it’s houses. We might have not taken anything physically but she was served and she cooperated with us very well.” The 15 others targeted saw their high-end cars and luxury homes - from Umhlanga to Ballito - seized. This is a temporary measure, and the outcome of the criminal case will determine if the assets are returned. Gumede, out on bail and her co-accused are expected back in court in January next year.
