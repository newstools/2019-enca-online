JOHANNESBURG - None of the DA leaders will be able to cushion the blow dealt to the party in the past week. That's according to political commentator Eusebius McKaiser. Former chief whip John Steenhuisen has been appointed the party's new Parliamentary leader following Mmusi Maimane's resignation. "I don't think anyone -- black or white -- from the DA will be able to reverse the implosion of the past days," said McKaiser.

Zille's return has seen Maimane and chairperson of the federal council Athol Trollip exit the party. "I think not only do they have the gift of splinter opposition, but this past week's decision by Helen will weaken the opposition parties and undermine the accountability dynamic," said Habib.
