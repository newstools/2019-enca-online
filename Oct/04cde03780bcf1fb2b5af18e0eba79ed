File: Stade have won just two games in nine matches this season, a record which has seen Heyneke Meyer's position come under intense scrutiny. PARIS - Former Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer received a vote of confidence from Stade Francais owner Hans-Peter Wild despite the Paris giants sitting rock bottom of the French Top 14. Stade have won just two games in nine matches this season, a record which has seen Meyer's position come under intense scrutiny. "Heyneke Meyer is and remains the sporting director and head coach," Wild told a news conference. "I have never contacted other coaches to replace him. I do not know (coaches) Vern Cotter or Gonzalo Quesada. I have never met them." Wild also insisted he "will continue to finance and run the club in order to make it one of the best teams in France and abroad." On Saturday, Stade travel to Agen where they will be without former South Africa back-rower Willem Alberts. The 43-time Springbok has been ruled out for up to four months with a bicep injury.
