File: Tulip bulbs should only be sold between August to December and planted before the start of the (northern hemisphere) winter, in order for the flowers to bloom in spring. AMSTERDAM - Tourists are being ripped off at Amsterdam's famous flower market, with just one percent of all bulbs sold at the floating bazaar ever producing a blossom, investigators said. A probe commissioned by the Dutch capital's municipality and tulip growers also found that often only one flower resembled the pictures on the packaging like colour, and that there were fewer bulbs than advertised. WATCH: Flower season in the Western Cape "The probe showed that there is chronic deception of consumers," at the sale of tulip bulbs at the flower market, the Royal General Bulb Growers' Association (KAVB) said. "Millions of tourists and day-trippers are being duped," KAVB chairman Rene le Clercq said in a statement. Amsterdam and the KAVB have now referred the matter to the Dutch consumer watchdog. Of 1,363 bulbs bought from the Singel and then planted, just 14 actually bloomed, the investigation said. Investigators found a similar problem along the so-called "flower bulb boulevard" in Lisse, a bulb-field town south of Amsterdam where the famous Keukenhof gardens are also situated.

"A tourist who buys a bad bulb is not likely to come back," he told Amsterdam's local AT5 news channel. Vendors at the market told AT5 that complaints were known. "There are indeed stalls here that sell rubbish. That is to everyone's disadvantage because it portrays the whole flower market in a bad light," one unidentified vendor said.
