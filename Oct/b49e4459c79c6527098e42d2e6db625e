They trusted the nanny to look after their toddler. But instead, it died in her care. eNCA's Zikhona Tshona spoke to the family in Daveyton. JOHANNESBURG - A family trusted the nanny to look after their toddler but instead, the baby died in her care. An East Rand childminder has now been arrested, accused of murder and the grief-stricken parents say she lied about what happened. When Lerato Mnguni arrived home on Friday, her son’s nanny told her that robbers had poisoned her, as well as Langelihle, and they then kidnapped the toddler. Only to find his dead body in a room - his mouth stuffed with a bandage. "I never thought something like this could happen to my son," Mnguni said.
