#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The SABC will at least be able to pay some of its long-overdue bills. The public broadcaster has been granted an R3.2-billion cash injection. The SABC will however only receive R2.1-billion of the R3.2-billion bailout. WATCH: Cash-strapped SABC receives R2bn bailout Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says more conditions need to be met before a further R1-billion will be paid. "Of the eight pre-conditions, the SABC has fully met five, partially met two, while one has not been met." Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams also acknowledged the broadcaster's initial request of R6.8-billion and says more cash injections will be considered.
