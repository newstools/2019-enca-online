READ: UPDATE: Pupil stabbed to death at Sebokeng school According to teacher Matshidiso Mokoena, the incident was a mistake and it's not related to gang violence in the school. "They were friends from primary schools I know them well.  They were in my class there was no crime involved,  it was a mistake, it was just an accident but it has nothing to do with gangsterism. I want to say to the government please stop taking away powers of us, as teachers, we are no longer allowed to discipline learners we are no longer allowed to say anything to learners whatever I say is against the law."
