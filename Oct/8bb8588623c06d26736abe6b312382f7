MOGADISHU - The United States said on Wednesday it had re-opened an embassy in Somalia's capital, 28 years after it was shut as the country plunged into civil war, highlighting warming ties between the two nations. Washington closed its embassy during the 1991 overthrow of president Siad Barre's military regime which ushered in decades of chaos, however, diplomatic relations have strengthened in recent years. "Today we reaffirm the relations between the American people and the Somali people, and our two nations," said Ambassador Donald Yamamoto in a statement.

A permanent diplomatic presence was established in Mogadishu in December 2018, however, was operated out of Nairobi. The country continues to be wracked by an Islamist insurgency, and Al-Shabaab militants on Monday staged an attack on a military base that is a major launching site for US drone operations, as well as a European Union convoy. US strikes in Somalia surged in April 2017, after President Donald Trump declared the south of the country an "area of active hostilities". "The United States remains a strong partner to Somalia in its effort to build a stable, credible, and democratic country," said the statement.
