So now the accused faces five counts, which is four counts of murder and one count of rape,” said spokesperson for the NPA in KwaZulu-Natal Natasha Kara. Outside the court, political parties came out in support of the mother. The accused remains in police custody and is expected back in court on the 7th of November.
