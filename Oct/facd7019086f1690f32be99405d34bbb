File: Twitter said its policy does not give free rein to policial figures. WASHINGTON - Twitter said world leaders are "not above" the rules of the online platform and could see their messages removed or demoted for egregious conduct violating its terms of service. In a statement aimed at clarifying its policies, Twitter said it reserves the right to take "enforcement action" on offending tweets, notably those including threats of violence or posting of private information. The move comes with social media, and Facebook in particular, facing pressure over enabling false and misleading statements from political leaders.

It would also act on the posting of intimate photos or videos of someone without consent, and any post related to child sexual exploitation or promoting self-harm. Twitter said it has not changed its policy which gives leeway to political speech. The policy announced in June exempts most political commentary from its rules.
