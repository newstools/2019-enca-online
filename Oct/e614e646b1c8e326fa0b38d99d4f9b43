The only thing we can do is to comply if such things happen, but it's really really painful because I wasn't aware, I was sleeping,” said Gumede Gumede said she does not own any luxurious cars. “I am poor as a church mouse,” she said. She still maintains she's innocent of all charges against her and says the Hawks left with nothing. “They went back empty-handed because I don't own any Lamborghini, any Porsche car. I am just having my old Prado and my van,” she said.
