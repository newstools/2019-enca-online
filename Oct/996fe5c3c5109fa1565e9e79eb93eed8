Cassie Ventura and Alex Fine celebrated their union with an intimate wedding in Malibu in August 2019. JOHANNESBURG - American singer Cassie Ventura and her man Alex Fine shared the first pictures from their wedding ceremony held in Malibu last month. According to Vogue the couple wanted an intimate ceremony and only invited 14 guests. “We wanted a simple venue with a beautiful view that felt warm and romantic,” Cassie said. “We wanted the aesthetic to reflect how comfortable and content we feel with each other.” READ: Cassie expecting first child with boyfriend Alex Fine The couple organized the ceremony two weeks after Fine proposed to Cassie and they enlisted the help of event planner Melissa Andre. “Melissa was a magician with the planning,” Cassie said. “Being that I was seven months pregnant, it wasn’t easy finding a dress in such a short time frame, so I worked with my stylists and friends Marni Senofonte and Deonte Nash to create a custom look with our tailor Arturo and his daughter Christina from Rancho Tailors.” Cassie and Fine met at the gym and are expecting their first child together in December.
