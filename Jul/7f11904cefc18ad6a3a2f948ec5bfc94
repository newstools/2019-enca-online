Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille says Mmusi Maimane's stance on Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane is a serious dilemma. Zille says he should not have approached the Public Protector's office about Bosasa's donation to Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC presidential campaign while at the same time calling for her removal. READ: Calls mount for Public Protector's head “When you have a compromised state, when you have a captured state and we believe that the public protector has been captured by a faction of the ANC which is very unfortunate because the public protector should do her job without fear or favour,” Zille said. “What is an opposition party to do when there is seemingly a legitimate complaint under the executive ethics act and that is your only recourse. So it is a terrible dilemma for the party, either you let an alleged breach of the executive ethics act go by or you take it to a compromised public protector.”
