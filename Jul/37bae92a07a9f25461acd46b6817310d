President Cyril Ramaphosa is calling for solutions, rather than the use of social media to air grievances. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - DA Caucus leader Solly Msimanga says the e-toll saga could have been solved as far back as 2014. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng’s provincial government were engaged in a twitter war on Friday over the e-toll issue. In his State of the Province Address last week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said that e-tolls have no future in the province but Makhura's comment was met with criticism from national treasury. On his Twitter account, Mboweni insisted that e-tolls won't be removed. READ: Ramaphosa condemns social media spat Makhura hit back, saying Mboweni has no power on the matter as he is not the president. Now the DA has entered the fray. The party says Mboweni's statement on Twitter confirms what it has said all along, that under the ANC, e-tolls are here to stay. According to the DA, Mboweni, not Makhura, has the final say on the matter as he is the national finance minister but the party says, if e-toll gantries are still active by August, it will take steps to declare an inter-governmental dispute to have the system set aside. Msimanga says he believes the system is here to stay. Watch the full interview above
