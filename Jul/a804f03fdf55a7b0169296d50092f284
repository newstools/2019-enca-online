Muthambi is among former Zuma-era Cabinet ministers who have been elected to oversee committees. She has been implicated in sharing confidential information with the controversial Gupta family, but she says she's not the villain she's made out to be. Muthambi is unfazed by the criticism levelled against her. READ: Outcry over parliamentary nominations “Otherwise I wouldn’t have been here. It doesn’t worry me a great deal," said Muthambi who will be chairing Parliament’s Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. "I’ve gone through all the objections raised.
