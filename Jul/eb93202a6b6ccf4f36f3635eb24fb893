The research, however, shows South Africa is making huge advances in the fight against the HIV/Aids epidemic. The global Aids update report was launched in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. United Nations Aids country director for South Africa, Mbulawa Mugabe says that most communities in South Africa have exceeded targets set for 2020. READ: AIDS deaths down a third since 2010: UN "At the centre of this is what communities have been able to do...it clearly shows that if you empower communities you will get the results you want to get," said Mugabe. "The challenge going forward is how can we sustain these good results....are we going to maintain the same level of intensity?" Mbulawa concluded that females aged 15 to 24 report 200 new cases of infections per day in South Africa alone, however, the government has plans in the pipeline to curb this epidemic. "We really need to invest in young people to bring this epidemic under control," he said.
