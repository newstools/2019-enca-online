JOHANNESBURG - Two Cape Town teenagers have been chosen to represent South Africa at the global School of Rock Allstars Programme in the US later this month. School of Rock students Shandy Sarantos and Rosie Bruce are hitting all the right notes. They've been handpicked to join 175 other international musicians on a 10-day musical tour of the US. This is as part of the prestigious School of Rock Allstars Programme. "It's such an honourable experience to be chosen to go to America and perform on big stages that we've never experienced with strangers that we have to now play with and rehearse with,” said Sarantos. “This would be my first time travelling overseas for any extracurricular, it’s an incredible opportunity and I feel so honoured it’s a real confidence boost to be told by the world and an established body that I’ve, got talent and so does Shandy,” Bruce added. The pair will be showing off their guitar and vocal skills alongside their respective band members who they'll only get to meet for the first time on tour. With over 30,000 students worldwide, it's a big feather in their cap to be a part of this. "The all-stars program is possibly the biggest achievement that any school of rock student can achieve. "Every year we run the programme and each individual school around the globe they get to nominate their students who they feel fit the criteria, and then they go through rigorous interview process where they had to submit a video and do a live audition and then Allstars get selected,” said Leigh Spaun, School of Rock co-founder.
