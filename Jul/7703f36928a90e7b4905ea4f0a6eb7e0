DJ Fresh (COPA Coca-Cola Anthem) during the 2018 Copa Coca-Cola National Final Press Conference at Clapham High School on September 19, 2018 in Pretoria, South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation confirmed on Tuesday that DJ Fresh's contract has been terminated with immediate effect. The public broadcaster said in a statement that the decision to terminate his contract had been reached following "unsuccessful engagements". I don't know when I'll be back on air: DJ Fresh "The termination follows unsuccessful engagements between SABC Radio Management and Mr Thato Sikwane, subsequent to his usage of offensive language on-air, resulting in the SABC being found guilty and sanctioned by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) for contravention of clause 6 of the BCCSA’s Code of Conduct", read the statement. DJ Fresh was suspended last month following an alleged verbal altercation with a listener on his show 'Fresh Breakfast'. On Monday, Fresh released a statement stating that he had been willing to apologise for the incident, a claim the SABC disputes. "Mr Sikwane was afforded an opportunity to remedy his contractual breaches, which he failed and/or refused to do." Fans have taken to social media to show support for Fresh following reports of the termination.
