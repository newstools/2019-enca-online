Great Britain's Simon Yates celebrates as he wins on the finish line of the twelfth stage of the 106th edition of the Tour de France cycling race between Toulouse and Bagneres-de-Bigorre. PARIS - Britain's Simon Yates won stage 12 of the Tour de France on Thursday, beating two other survivors of a mass breakaway in the Pyrenees. Defending champion Geraint Thomas and current overall leader Julian Alaphilippe finished the slog over two tough climbs together as any anticipated top 10 shake-up failed to materialise. Yates is over an hour adrift in the overall standings, but punched the air in joy after adding a Tour de France stage to victories in the Vuelta and Giro.

Overall leader Alaphilippe led the peloton south the pink-bricked city of Toulouse for stage 12's two mist-shrouded Pyrenean peaks after vowing to hold on to the yellow jersey. The two major obstacles on the road to the rural outpost of Bagneres-de-Bigorre were Tour classic: the 13.2km ascent of the Col de Peyresourde at an average of 7 percent followed by a steeper climb to Hourquette d'Ancizan. The day finished with a downhill charge to the finish line.
