#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Political analyst Prince Mashele says he's not surprised by President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to review Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings against him. Mashele says the President failed to answer critical questions about him and his relationship with Bosasa. “I don't trust the President myself because the President is conflicted in this matter. So it needs to be adjudicated by a different body.” WATCH: Ramaphosa to take PP's report on judicial review Mashele added that it's still unclear who to trust between Ramaphosa and Mkhwebane. Meanwhile, Public Works Minister Patricia De Lille says South Africans should respect the office of the Public Protector.
