SA Marine Fuels proceeded to dispatch a commercial oil spill response service provider to mitigate and contain the spread of the spill. JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries is monitoring an oil spill in Algoa Bay. Up to 400 litres of fuel spilled into the sea while being transferred to a Liberian-registered vessel, MV Chrysanthi. “This incident is currently considered a Tier 1 level incident which does not require intervention from the national authorities as local resources are sufficient,” the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries said in a statement. “The department will provide assistance if the incident escalates and requires it.” Bad weather in the area hampered operations and officials haven't been able to properly assess the spill.
