ANC KZN Secretary General Mdumiseni Ntuli says the pair shouldn't be back at work until the PEC receives a report from the provincial working committee. "No, they shouldn't be back at work today or tomorrow until the PEC receives a report from the provincial working committee and then take a decision about what more, if any, still needs to be done in order for the matter to be settled." WATCH: 'Bring back our mayor', says Gumede's supporters But Gumede's supporters say she'll report for duty on Thursday.
