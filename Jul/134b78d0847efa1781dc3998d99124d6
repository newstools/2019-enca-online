JOHANNESBURG - The 2013 Waterkloof Air Force Base landing for a Gupta family wedding at Sun City is on the state capture inquiry agenda on Tuesday. The A330 touched down at Waterkloof Air Force Base, ferrying guests destined for the Sun City wedding of Vega Gupta.
Former Transport Minister Ben Martins and Chief of Air Navigation Services, Hennie Marais, will be giving testimony. The legal team is in the process of identifying other witnesses who will be called to appear before the Commission over the next few weeks. READ: The rise and fall of the Gupta empire The Gupta family said in a statement released in 2013 that Waterkloof Air Force Base was used with full permission of the authorities.
The statement implied foreign dignitaries and ministers are among the wedding guests who landed at the national key point. A report released in 2013 said former president Jacob Zuma and his Cabinet had no involvement in the landing. Names had been "dropped" during the course of the probe, including that of Martins, Zuma and former Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. The Zondo Commission is looking into the Gupta family's rise to the pinnacle of the country’s financial and political echelons.
