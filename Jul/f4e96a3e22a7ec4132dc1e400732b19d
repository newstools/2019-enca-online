Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA – Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament in relation to a donation from controversial company Bosasa, now known as African Global Operations. “The South African law is silent on whether Cabinet members or Presidents may amend or make corrections to their oral replies to Parliament. This is a grey area which calls for Parliament's attention. It, therefore, goes without saying although President Ramaphosa may have justified to correct the earlier statement he had made...he did mislead Parliament,” she said.
