Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane that he's taken note of the findings against Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan. However, the president feels it is inappropriate to take disciplinary action against Gordhan until legal processes are concluded. In a statement released on Monday, the Presidency said Ramaphosa has complied with Mkhwebane’s recommendations. “President Ramaphosa said that having considered the Public Protector’s findings against Minister Gordhan as well as the Minister’s challenges to those findings in his review application, it would be inappropriate to take disciplinary action against Minister Gordhan at this point.” WATCH: Mkhwebane takes Gordhan saga to Youtube In May, Mkhwebane found Gordhan had violated the Constitution. She found him guilty of improper conduct during his tenure as SARS commissioner. It relates to his approval of early retirement with full pension benefits for former Deputy SARS Commissioner, Ivan Pillay.

The president says he sent a response to Mkhwebane’s office on 19 June explaining his reason for not implementing disciplinary action against Gordhan. “In the event, the President submitted to the Public Protector that the process of taking appropriate disciplinary action against Minister Gordhan would best be served by waiting until the legal processes of his review proceedings were concluded,” the Presidency added.
