Tiger Woods leaves the 18th hole after the second round of the British Open golf Championships. PORTRUSH - Tiger Woods will take time off to rest and recuperate after a difficult two days at the British Open left him with little chance of making the cut at Royal Portrush. Despite shooting a one-under-par round on Friday, the 15-time major champion was made to paid for a disastrous first round of 78 to finish on six over, still five shots off the projected cut. "I just want some time off just to get away from it," said Woods, who plans to return for the FedEx Cup playoffs next month. "I had a long trip to Thailand (on holiday) and then trying to get ready for this event, to play this event, it's been a lot of travel, a lot of time in the air, a lot of moving around and different hotels and everything. I just want to go home." Woods admitted to felling "sore" as his troublesome back stiffened up in cold conditions on Thursday and changed his swing slightly to shoot a markedly improved score in his second round. "I just torqued my setup differently, just tried to make some minor changes swing-wise. Because let's be honest, I don't have the flexibility I used to have, and never will. So I'm going to have to make those adaptations." A three-time Open champion, Woods is set to miss the cut for only the third time in his 21 appearances.
