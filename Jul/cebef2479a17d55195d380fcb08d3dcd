JOHANNESBURG - Four pupils have travelled to Harvard University in the United States for a two-week-long educational programme initiated by the University of Limpopo. That's after an extensive selection process conducted by the Limpopo based university's rural innovation hub earlier this year. WATCH: University of Limpopo students boycott 'difficult exam' "Leaners from 12 schools in and around Limpopo were given a variety of topics to write essay's on and the best two learners were selected in the first phase," said Masethulela Magagane, from the Limpopo Department of Education. "The learners then went through the second phase where they each had to write further essays at the University of Limpopo." Refentse Mamabolo from Bjatladi High school,  Marcia Sehlapelo from Frans Mohala High school, Thabiso Matjoko and Monicca Maponya both from Mountainview High school were the eventual winners. The rural innovation hub spearheaded by Dr.Chirs Burnam, Alida Van Wyk and Cuzette Du Plessis from the University of Limpopo assisted the pupils with acquiring passports and Visa.
