Unfortunately, Andrew Mlangeni and Dennis Goldberg couldn't attend due to ill health but former president Kgalema Motlanthe was there to reflect on the politics of the day. Motlanthe says some leaders are using the ANC for their own financial benefit to the detriment of the poor.

"People are using the organisation to get rich at the expense of the people whilst the people wallow in poverty," Motlanthe said. Motlanthe says it's time for the younger generation ascend to leadership, and warned that if this doesn't happen, it will harm the country's future.
