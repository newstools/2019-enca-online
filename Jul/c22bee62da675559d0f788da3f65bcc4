Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A top general in the SANDF and his wife are being investigated for tender irregularities involving multimillion-rand contracts. Reports suggest Nombasa Ntsondwa-Ndhlovu's company Umkhombe Marine was awarded contracts worth over a R100-million. The contracts for military equipment were allegedly awarded without following proper tender processes.

The pair were romantically linked at the time the tender was awarded but Ntsondwa-Ndhlovu said the major-general was out of the country and not involved at this specific time. She did not declare the romantic involvement, reportedly as Ndhlovu was not involved in the adjudication process of the tender.

She stated the allegations of corruption were untrue and the company was not aware that they were under investigation. "He is just a medical doctor, his responsibility in the SANDF/SAMS is to worry about the well-being of a soldier, that's it," Ntondwa-Ndhlovu said. "He doesn't know who gets the tenders, he doesn't know who sits on the boards so it's impossible, this is just a smear campaign to come after my husband," she said.
