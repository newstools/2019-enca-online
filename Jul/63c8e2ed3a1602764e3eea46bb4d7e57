President Cyril Ramaphosa also defended Gordhan in Parliament on Thursday. READ: EFF defends protest against Gordhan He's told the EFF to allow court processes and the law to take its course. "The extraordinary attack by [Julius] Malema on Minister Gordhan requires a response," Ramaphosa said. "I'm in no position to express a view on the Public Protector's findings against Gordhan. But I have a view on his character and his contribution. I appointed him because he's a person of commitment and integrity," he said. READ: Mkhwebane to fight Ramaphosa's court bid over Gordhan The EFF called on Ramaphosa to fire Gordhan after the Public Protector's adverse findings against him. Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Gordhan violated the Constitution and directed Ramaphosa to take action against him. Meanwhile, the SACP and Ahmed Kathrada Foundation are planning a protest on Sunday under the banner of combatting corruption. READ: SACP, Kathrada Foundation call for an end to corruption Malema has called the protest one "in defence of the rogue unit". Malema said the Public Protector's office must be defended and protected. "The office of the PP must be protected because if we are going to protect it, then we might as well close it because its remedial actions are not binding," he said. "They are overlooked and people can pretend to not understand what is expected of them."
