The ANC's NEC is meeting this weekend in Irene. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - ANC stalwarts and veterans say public attacks on ANC officials are part of an orchestrated campaign to divert attention from corruption and state capture. The stalwarts have written an open letter under the banner 'For the Sake of Our Future'. READ: ANC NEC to decide ANCYL's future In the letter penned to the party's top six and national executive committee members, the veterans throw their full support behind Derek Hanekom. Earlier this week ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule labelled Hanekom a charlatan working to divide the governing party. Hanekom's political future is up for discussion at this weekend's NEC meeting.  #ANCNEC member @Derek_Hanekom at the party’s NEC meeting currently taking place at Saint George’s Hotel. pic.twitter.com/Z34l7esBtb
