Andre Esterhuizen (R) vies for the ball with Australia's Nic White (L) during the 2019 Rugby Championship match. AUCKLAND - South Africa have added centre Andre Esterhuizen and lock Marvin Orie to their squad for the final Rugby Championship clash with Argentina in Salta on 10 August. The pair have flown to the Springboks' training camp in Auckland, New Zealand, where the squad will train this week ahead of the trip to Buenos Aires at the weekend. Coach Rassie Erasmus chose to stay in New Zealand rather than fly back to South Africa and then embark on another gruelling journey west to Argentina via Brazil. Both Esterhuizen and Orie featured in the Boks 35-17 victory over Australia in Johannesburg on July 20, but did not travel with the squad that drew 16-16 with New Zealand in Wellington on Saturday.

His replacement, Herschel Jantjies, scored a last minute try to claim the draw for the Boks that leaves them a bonus-point win away from securing a first Rugby Championship title since 2009. The squad will fly to Argentina in two batches over the coming weekend and will be based in Buenos Aires, before flying to Salta next Thursday. They will then face Argentina in a one-off test in Pretoria on 17 August before they fly to Japan for the Rugby World Cup.
