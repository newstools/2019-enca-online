I remember our very first show in Paris in 1987... He was just amazing. It was very funny, none of us could speak French... I travelled to New York with Jesse Clegg, it's just amazing family. The world loved him, he was just a down-to-earth guy." Danny K, who worked with Clegg says, he was more than a musician and was able to unite the country through his music.
