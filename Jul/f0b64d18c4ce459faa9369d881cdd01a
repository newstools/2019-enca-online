The Fourth Industrial Revolution represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another but how does it affect workers with artificial intelligence coming into the fray. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - Cosatu President Zingiswa Losi has urged embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and her supporters to remember that the ANC holds power in the municipality, not individuals. Gumede is accused of fraud and corruption and is out on R50,000 bail. The ANC in KwaZulu placed Gumede on a 30-day leave, which has since lapsed. She was expected to resume her mayoral duties on Thursday but the ANC is adamant that she can't return to work. WATCH: The footage that got eNCA reporter into trouble with police Gumede's supporters clashed with the police on Thursday morning causing pandemonium in front of the Durban City hall. The supporters insist that she must be allowed to resume her official duties. However, Losi says that leaders must abide by the party's decisions. “If leaders are leaders of the organisation and they abide by the decision of the movement particular the resolutions of the ANC," Losi said. “That leader should rise above those that are calling for her to return.”
