KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu says his department will be working with authorities to establish the cause of the fire. “It is unfortunate that it is one of the critical buildings that has been engulfed in fire because it houses the district office director as well as the human resource responsible for uMgungundlovu District,” Mshengu said. “At this stage, we don’t want to venture into speculation of what might have caused the fire.” Important administration documents, computers and equipment have been destroyed in a fire at the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education’s headquarters in Pietermaritzburg.
