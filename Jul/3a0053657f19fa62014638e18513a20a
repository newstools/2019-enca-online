More revelations at the state capture inquiry. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Doctor Radebe, a former DA Councillor in the Phumelele Municipality in the Free State, says his life was in danger. Radebe told the Zondo Commission he was attacked after speaking to the media about dead carcasses at the Estina dairy farm. He claims former Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane was responsible for the attacks. EAD: Millions spent on Estina farm equipment, Zondo Commission hears "I was even attacked personally by a group of people who I believe were Mr Zwane's private force," Radebe said. "After he got into the position of agricultural MEC he had dubious employments. He hired five people without following proper procedures. "You cannot hire people who are friends when the population of that area is so big, which means the posts were created especially for them." Radebe says it's not right to live in fear in a democratic country.
