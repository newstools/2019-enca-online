#Dstv403 CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town domestic worker is not only cleaning house butÂ cleaning up with her dance moves. Her employer, who happens to be one of South Africa's musical greats, covertly captured her moves on camera. Nomachina Tyali, or Nomi as she's fondly known, has been working as a domestic worker for the past 18 years. But when she started working for The Kiffness frontman, David Scott, who runs his studio from home, Nomi, found her rhythm, dancing to his tunes while cleaning. David, secretly filmed her breaking it down mid-vacuum and it sparked an idea to drop a song and music video in honour of Nomi. eNCA's Tanya Nefdt has more in the video above.
