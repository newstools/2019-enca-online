"So when Jon, the director said to me, I want you to play Rafiki, I was on the set of Black Panther and I didn't know who this guy is because the set is dark." "He said I want you to voice Rafiki and I thought this is Hollywood saying they are trying to make you a star and they never come back but he came back and we began to work together", said Kani. Meanwhile, local stars including Cassper Nyovest, DJ Zinhle and Enhle Mbali Maphumulo graced the red carpet at the premier of the movie in South African on Thursday night.
