File: The SANDF is reportedly disciplining an employee for refusing to remove her headscarf. JOHANNESBURG - The CRL Rights Commission is expected to meet with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) after reports that a staff member is facing a disciplinary hearing for allegedly refusing to remove her headscarf. The SANDF says all employees are governed by a dress code, and people wanting to practice their religions should do so within the "military culture and code". In a statement released on Monday, the commission said it is important for all organisations and companies to ensure that their policies do not unfairly discriminate against employees based on religion.
