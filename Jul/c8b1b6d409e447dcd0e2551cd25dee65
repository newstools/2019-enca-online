Tigers at a Belgian zoo were treated to chickens in giant ice cubes as the heatwave continues. BRUSSELS - Belgian zookeepers at Pairi Daiza fed chickens in giant ice cubes to tigers as northern Europe baked in record temperatures during another heatwave that climate experts believe could become the new normal. For the second time in a month, a high-pressure system drew scorching air from the Sahara desert, breaking records for Belgium and the Netherlands, and threatening the same in Britain, Germany and France in a heatwave due until Friday. Keepers fed watermelons, also encased in ice, to their bears. Visitors also received a free bottle of water. "We made caves with air conditioning inside for pandas, as they are the most vulnerable to such hot weather, but they still prefer to stay outside, because they love the space," zoo spokesman Mathieu Goedefroy said. Climate specialists warned that such heatwaves were becoming more frequent as a result of global warming from greenhouse gas emissions. "With further climate change there could be a 50 percentÂ chance of having hot summers in future. That's similar to saying that a normal summer in future will be as hot as our hottest summers to date," said Declan Finney, a research fellow at the University of Leeds in Britain. Bruneau Etienne, president of Belgian beekeeping federation CARI, said bees were under threat because at excessive temperatures, they preferred to stay inside hives, meaning they did not collect pollen and risked dehydration. "If the situation continues, colonies of bees will die," he said.
