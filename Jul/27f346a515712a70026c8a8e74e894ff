Northcliff's furry visitor has been spotted again. JOHANNESBURG - Authorities have set a trap for the baboon still on the loose in Johannesburg's Northcliff suburb. It’s been three weeks since the creature was spotted in Krugersdorp and it has since made its way across town to the hills. It's been seen moving through properties in the Northcliff area.

Residents are being urged to be on the look-out. WATCH: Elusive baboon spotted as Northcliff residents on high alert While people are wondering why the primate is here, CLAW says his territory has changed. “The fact is they are becoming more visible now because we are building on ridges along waterways," said Cora Bailey. "He's not a danger to anyone, he's terrified of dogs, he's terrified of traffic and he has no protection of his troop.” CLAW has appealed to the public to report sightings of the baboon on 076 850 4466 and to please stay calm.
