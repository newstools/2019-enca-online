They are the only two rail options in Gauteng but the difference in service is worlds apart. Newly appointed Gauteng MEC of Transport Jacob Mamabolo says one service provider must learn from the other.

"The way I want to work is I must give Prasa the opportunity to look at it and the minister has committed to look at those issues.” READ: Gautrain to take action against texting bus driver The Gautrain Management Agency plans to extend the service from Jabulani in Soweto to Mamelodi in Pretoria but funding still needs to be approved by Treasury.
