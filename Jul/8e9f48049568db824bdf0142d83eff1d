Lake Pontchartrain flood-gates are seen closed ahead of Tropical Storm Barry in New Orleans. LOUISIANA - Millions of residents in Louisiana braced for impact from Tropical Storm Barry, which is threatening the southern US state and its largest city New Orleans with potentially disastrous rainfall and flooding. Authorities ramped up evacuations, airlines cancelled flights and flood gates slammed shut as the National Hurricane Center forecast the strengthening storm would reach hurricane status on Saturday and roar ashore along the state's central coast. The large storm system currently in the Gulf of Mexico brings heavy rains and potential storm surge and flooding that pose a threat reminiscent of 2005's deadly Hurricane Katrina. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans was well prepared to withstand the storm, but urged vigilance by residents there and across the state, as authorities called on people to stay off the streets. "No one should take this storm lightly, and I urge everyone to remain informed," Edwards said on Twitter. If the storm becomes a hurricane, it would be the first of the Atlantic season, which runs from June to November. Louisiana is facing an extraordinarily dangerous confluence of conditions, experts said. The level of the Mississippi River, already swollen from historic rains and flooding upstream, was at 4.9 metres in New Orleans, one foot shy of flood stage. Authorities closed highways in several locations along the coast as floodwaters began creeping in. In 2005, Katrina -- the costliest and deadliest hurricane in US history -- submerged about 80 percent of New Orleans, causing some 1,800 deaths and more than $150-billion in damage.
