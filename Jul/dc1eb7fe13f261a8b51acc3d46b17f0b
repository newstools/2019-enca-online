Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Port Elizabeth born Designer Papama Mtwisha is a living proof that indeed ‘Africa’s Time is Now’. Mtwisha has managed to score a massive international distribution deal with major US luxury department store Bloomingdale. Her Unisex T-shirts, embedded with the slogan ‘Africa, Your Time Is Now’ are selling like hot cakes at stores across the US - from New York to LA and San Francisco. READ: SA street artist makes global impact on conservation Mtwisha says she has always believed in the message behind the slogan on her t-shirts. "I strongly believe in the message, I always have for the last few years and I just decided to do something about it", said Mtwisha. Her t-shirts will be available worldwide and retail at $58 (R816). ‘If you can dream it, you can achieve it’ Still so surreal to see our “with love from Africa label” with a @bloomingdales swingtag.. We started this ‘movement’ with the aim of having everyone  who is African by birth or by state of mind exposed to this powerful truth. I had no idea of exactly how I was going to achieve that, yet I did not let that deter me from the mission. Almost 2 years after launch, we are now available at #Bloomingdales (#NYCflagship , #Soho, #SanFrancisco and #LosAngeles) stores all over the US, including their online store, which distributes worldwide .. look at GOD.. Only by His gracious hand.. NOW IS THE TIME to free our minds and properly believe in ourselves. We need to realise that we all have an unlimited power within us, and we need to use it right. What makes me more excited, is the fact that the @africayourtimeisnow movement gained traction at home first, before the international community took notice. A brand for us, by us. Thank you to every single person that has contributed to the success of this movement. Those that have kept the vibration alive by recommending, tagging, sending us messages on how the message makes them feel, bought some tees for themselves and as gifts, sent good vibes etc.  Thank you to my friends and family for all the support they have selflessly given our small company with a HUGE vision.. I don’t take you guys for granted.  @florence_calvet you are such a rock star, an angel, an enabler and just a superb human being. Thank you for facilitating this.  The #StyleKingdom pop-up (with some other super cool brands from the continent) launches on the 16th of July at the @bloomingdales flagship store in #NYC 🌍 A post shared by  papamamar (@papamamar) on Jul 11, 2019 at 10:00pm PDT
