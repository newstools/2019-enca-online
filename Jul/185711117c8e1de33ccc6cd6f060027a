Head of Impact Investment Royith Rajdhar will be cross-examined at the PIC Inquiry today. He will be cross-examined by MST (Mobile Specialised Technologies). PRETORIA - The fund that's been the most at risk with all that's been going down at the PIC, is set to have its say. The Government Employees Pension Fund will take the stand on Monday, before former CEO Dan Matjila continues with his testimony. There has been allegation after allegation against Matjila and evidence against him has continued to pile up. Matjila has been placed at the centre of questionable deals that the asset manager conducted, and accused of flouting processes there but he has told the commission he left the PIC in good standing and denies any wrongdoing. The former PIC head says despite evidence heard before the inquiry, there are sufficient and adequate checks and balances in place at the asset manager. WATCH: Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila's day of reckoning Matjila has also told the inquiry there's too much political interference at the PIC. While it's common practice to appoint the deputy finance minister as the chairman of the board, Matjila says this needs to be relooked because there could be a conflict of interest. The PIC now has a new board - this after it was operating in limbo since February when the previous board threw in the towel. Matjila also says speculation is unfounded that he forced two companies, KiliCap and Sakhumnotho, to pair up to benefit from over R1-billion in PIC funding, so as to buy shares in Total SA. He says it just so happened that the two companies met at the PIC and eventually decided to pair up. The commission resumes on Monday.
