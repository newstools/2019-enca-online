No. There are many things involved in that," Mbalula said. "We need to look at all options." The minister announced a number of projects to improve public transport. Among these is a feasibility study on a high-speed rail link between Gauteng and Durban and the implementation of the Moloto Rail Corridor, a 130km link between Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga and Tshwane in Gauteng.
