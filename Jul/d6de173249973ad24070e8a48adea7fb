SACP wants an inquiry into Busisiwe Mkhebane’s fitness to hold office JOHANNESBURG - The Public Protector has denied claims she received money from a Gupta-linked company while working as a diplomat in China. Reacting on Twitter, Busisiwe Mkhwebane has called the report by online news site Organised Crime And Corruption Reporting, 'fake news'.  READ: Ramaphosa, Mkhwebane court case postponed Khadija Sharife and Mark Anderson are credited as the authors of the article. According to banking records leaked to the OCCRP, global giant HSBC flagged Mkhwebane as having links to the Guptas. The report mentions a payment of R71,000 into Mkhwebane's FNB account in June 2014. The money is alleged to have been sent from an account at HSBC's subsidiary in Hong Kong.

HSBC spokesman Ankit Patel said regarding Mkhwebane's possible links to the family, “we continue to investigate any potential links to the Guptas or Gupta-related companies. “We will review any name that comes to our attention for potential involvement in financial crime and exit those relationships as appropriate.” In a statement, the public protector stated the report is malicious and defamatory. She characterised the report as part of the "dirty tricks campaign" that have begun since she has begun investigating high-profile figures. Mkhwebane said the report will not deter her from discharging her functions "with renewed vigour, without fear, favour, or prejudice".
