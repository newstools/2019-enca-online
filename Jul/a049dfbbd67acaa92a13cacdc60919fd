WELLINGTON - Versatile back Jordie Barrett signed a three-year contract extension that will keep him with the All Blacks until the end of 2022. The 22-year-old has scored eight tries in 10 Tests since making his international debut against Samoa in 2017. "Staying in New Zealand rugby is really important to me," he said. "I'm enjoying playing alongside my mates and I've got further aspirations and goals I want to reach while I'm playing in New Zealand."

His contract includes an option to switch Super Rugby teams after next year's season and Barrett said he was keen on playing at some point with his brothers. One sibling Scott is with the title-winning Canterbury Crusaders, while eldest brother Beauden recently moved from the Hurricanes to Auckland Blues. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said Barrett, who can play anywhere across the backline, had "a big future" in the game. "He's an outstanding, talented young player who has soaked up everything he can in the All Blacks environment and grabbed every opportunity with both hands," he said.
