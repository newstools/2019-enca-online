Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu says ministers have two months to read and discuss the Presidential Advisory Panel report on land reform and agriculture. CAPE TOWN - A draft motion likely to be passed by lawmakers would give a new parliamentary committee until March 2020 to report back on proposed constitutional changes that would allow expropriation of land without compensation. Last year, the ANC proposed a controversial constitutional amendment that would allow the government to seize land without compensation, but the process has stalled.

It would give the committee, consisting of 11 voting members of the National Assembly -- six of whom are ANC members and rest from opposition parties -- until 31 March 2020 to report back.

Wide public support has put pressure on the ANC to follow through but the land question has drawn criticism from commercial farmers and opposition politicians who warn it will scare off investors and potentially harm food production. But President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has described land dispossession as the "original sin", has sought to allay any fears and said plans to accelerate land reform will not hurt food security nor damage the struggling economy.
