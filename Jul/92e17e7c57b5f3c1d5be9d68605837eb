Speaking at the Kader Asmal Human Rights Lecture in Johannesburg, Batohi assuredÂ South Africans that arrests will be made in corruption-related cases. She acknowledges that it's a slow process, but all those found in the wrong will eventually face the full might of the law. "Many people say to me, 'we want to see people in orange overalls'. It will happen, but when we do it, we have to make sure we get it right because those that will be arrested will hire the most competent firms and make lots of lawyers very rich. The strategy is not to deal with the merits of the case but to everything outside of that. People will be arrested. We need to show people that the wheels of justice are turning." WATCH: Batohi vows to restore faith in NPA Batohi has also warned state looters the prosecution body is coming for them. She says they will arrest corruption enablers and also work towards recovering stolen money.
"Asset forfeiture is hugely important. It's not just about putting people in prison, it's about bringing back the money. It's an insane amount of money stolen. We need to ensure that in addition to holding people accountable, we bring back the money. Asset forfeiture is a very important strategy to deal with corruption."
