Water Polo Coach Sarah Harries, dismissed in May, is finally speaking out. After remaining tight-lipped for five weeks, Harris has broken her silence about her controversial dismissal. In a blog post published on Tuesday, she accuses Swimming South Africa of maladministration. Among the issues she raised, she mentioned the lack of women representatives in the coaching staff, including for the women’s teams as well as interference in selections. Swimming South Africa declined to comment on the matter, confirming only that an internal disciplinary process involving Harris was underway.
