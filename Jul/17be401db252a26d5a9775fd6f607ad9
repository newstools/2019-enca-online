After the forced removals, it was renamed Keizergracht Street.
The committee has officially lodged a request with the City of Cape Town to restore its former name.
Shahied Ajam, the chairman of the committee said, "for us apart from the emotional and sentimental importance of it, it is also very historical. "We must remember Hanover Street was already demarcated in 1854. So it's of historical importance and more importantly, we must remember that. "People wanting to come back to District Six will not heal if we don't have Hanover Street."
The public participation process officially closes on 22 July. READ: District Six land claimants still optimistic Residents are being urged to make their mark.
