WATCH: WC police to investigate 11 weekend murders On Friday night police discovered the bodies of six women who'd been gunned down at a home in Marcus Garvey. On Saturday evening five men were shot dead and another wounded in two separate incidents. Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz says he's considering declaring a state of emergency in the province.
"No one seems to be taking the matter seriously. We as the government in the Western Cape think we should call the state of emergency in the Western Cape." Fritz blamed the lack of resources in police stations for poor policing. He said police management infighting is also a factor.
