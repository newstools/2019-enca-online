File: Ekuhurleni Metro Police Department. JOHANNESBURG - The Ekuhurleni Metro Police Department (EMDP) has called on anybody with information to come forward after a video showing a high speeding motorist went viral on social media. In the video, the motorist's vehicle clocked 322km/h on the R21 Highway in Ekuhurleni. "If we had the number plate..we would be able to track down or locate the registered owner of the vehicle - who was driving on that particular day. As it is right now...it is a problem unless somebody can come forward...even those who took the video can come and provide us with the number plate", said EMPD spokesperson, Wilfred Kgasago. READ: Motorist filmed driving over 300km/h on Joburg highway Kgasago says the motorist will face the full might of the law as such reckless behaviour is considered to be extremely irresponsible and a danger to society. "This is very atrocious and unacceptable...imagine if the driver had lost control of the vehicle...that guy would've ended up causing a horrific accident and chances are that innocent motorists would've also been involved", he said. "We could pursue this and try to arrest him [motorist], but the only problem here would be the justice system...will the courts say the video is admissible in court?"
