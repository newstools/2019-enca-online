Dietitian Mayuri Bhawan advises on how we can strengthen our immune systems this winter. #eNCA  JOHANNESBURG - Strengthening the immune system through a healthy diet plays an important role in ensuring that you do not fall ill this winter. Dietitian Mayuri Bhawan says supplementing with multi-vitamins is not enough. "Research has shown that just supplementing with vitamin C doesn't actually prevent you from getting cold and flu, in some cases, vitamin C can help reduce the duration of the illness." Health Check: does sex count as exercise? "I think we have to go back and look at what you eat and not necessarily what you supplement, you can't expect to eat poorly, taking a supplement and then having your immune system be highly effective," said Bhawan. Bhawan says there are many healthy ingredients that can be added to meals which will help strengthen the immune system this winter. "There are so many things we can add this winter and one of those things is ginger, which has great anti-inflammatory properties. Looking at garlic, which helps with its immune boosting effects."
