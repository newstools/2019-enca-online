OUTA CEO Wayne Duvenage asked whether E-toll payers will be reimbursed if the system is scrapped JOHANNESBURG - If you have been faithfully paying your e-toll bill, you probably won't get your money back if the system is scrapped. E-tolls made headlines again last week following a Twitter spat between Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier David Makhura. President Cyril Ramaphosa has now instructed the two to work with Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to find a solution and give a report back at the end of next month.

"We don't see how they will force [the] government or Sanral to get their funds back."
This is the grim reality faced by least 20 percent of motorists who have been paying their e-tolls. "We believe the status quo should remain, if you've been paying, then continue to pay, it's going to probably last a couple more months," said Duvenage.

It seems it's now up to Mbalula to help find a solution once and for all.
