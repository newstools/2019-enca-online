File: President Donald Trump told the four congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin. WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump strongly denied accusations of racism on Tuesday following a series of tweets targeted at a group of ethnic minority Democratic congresswomen. "Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don't have a Racist bone in my body!" tweeted Trump, as US lawmakers prepared to vote on a resolution condemning his "racist comments." In a series of tweets launched on Sunday attacking the four lawmakers - who are of Hispanic, Arab, Somali and African American origin - Trump urged them to "go back" to their countries of origin.

Slamming the "so-called vote" scheduled for later Tuesday as a "Democrat con game," Trump urged his fellow Republicans not to "show 'weakness' and fall into their trap." "This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country," the president wrote. "Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said." "Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party," Trump added, in a jab at the House leader who, until now, had a tenuous relationship with the four left-leaning first-term congresswomen. "See you in 2020!" said the president.
