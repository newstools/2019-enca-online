Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town woman is taking her obsession for David Beckham to the next level by tossing aside her team jersey for something a little more permanent. Twenty-nine-year-old, Kelly Steer, has decided to get the name and team number of the former Man United star and England captain inked for life on her back. The Beckhams are officially billionaires: report "I think I was about seven when I noticed this guy in the No. 7 jersey playing for Man United and I was drooling and then as the years went by my obsession just grew. "Long story short I got fed up with my memorabilia getting misplaced or damaged and I thought why not get a jersey okay but it’s expensive, so why not get a permanent jersey.  It will stay with me until I pass on.” The piece took seven hours to tattoo over two sessions but for  Kelly says it was all worth it.
