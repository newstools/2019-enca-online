JOHANNESBURG - Local rapper Cassper Nyovest caused a stir on social media after saying he wished he was a Nigerian national. The Tito Mboweni hit maker made the comment over the weekend during a discussion with Zakes Bantwini regarding the state of the South African music industry. In response to the tweet a fan said he wished the rapper was from Nigeria, to which the rapper then said: "Won't even lie. I wish I was from Nigeria too. The love they have for their own artists, the way they celebrate their culture, 90% local content on radio and TV,  the way they celebrate their music no matter where they are in the world, the unity within their industry. A DREAM!" The tweet has received major backlash on social media from fans who feel like they have supported the rapper since the beginning of his musical career.
