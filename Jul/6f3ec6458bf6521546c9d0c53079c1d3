File: President Cyril Ramaphosa's office says he's studying the Public Protector's report that declares him guilty of breaking the executive ethics code. JOHANNESBURG - The ANC says it's confident that president Cyril Ramaphosa is the right person to fight all forms of corruption. The ANC statement comes amid Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s damning findings against the president. She's found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament when he responded to a question about the R500,000 donation by Bosasa boss Gavin Watson.

He further accused Mkhwebane of unilaterally extending the scope of her investigation. Ramaphosa initially said the R500,000 payment was made to his son for services rendered. He later retracted the answer and clarified that it was a donation to his ANC presidential campaign.
