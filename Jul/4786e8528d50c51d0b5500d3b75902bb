Courtesy #DStv403 WELLINGTON - The Springboks and the All Blacks share one of sport's big rivalries and fixtures between these two countries are always highly contested. Saturday's match will be a test of South Africa's leadership group. A new captain will lead the Springboks in the absence of injured Siya Kolisi. Duane Vermeulen will be that person, while surrounded by many other leaders in the squad. Former Springbok captain Jean De Villiers says captaincy is a collective effort. "Captaincy is not something that's just down to one guy,” De Villiers said. “It's a core group of players that needs to help with that and Duane will have his own way of captaining, you can't take responsibility for everything, you need to be accountable for everything but you need guys that can help you with that in that situation. “A Handre Pollard will be helping in terms of the kicking game, Malcolm with the scrums, and so you can go down the line with all the leaders in the group. It's important that they function well together, and that they all aligned."

"Look, they've got a game plan that's been pretty well suited over the last year, and they're continually adapting it,” Read said. “The guys they've got in the side this week are slightly different to how they played against Australia. "So, you know with Faf at nine, pretty exciting player. They've got boots across the board and, you know, we turn up and prepare how we can play and accordingly look at what they are going to bring and hopefully negate it." The Springboks beat the All Blacks at the Westpac Stadium last year, and there is no doubt Read's men will want to avenge that. eNCA sports reporter Justin Ford has more details in the video above.
