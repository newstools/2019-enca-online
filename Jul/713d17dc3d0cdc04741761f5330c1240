Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu is blaming South Africa's dreadful employment crisis on the current leadership. The federation's deputy president, Mike Shingange says the economy's unemployment issue has been a crisis for quite some time and that nothing has been done to suggest that South Africa will get a different result. READ: SA's unemployment rate now at 29% "We have been pursuing the same trajectory. Nothing drastic has happened and despite good policies, job and investments summits that took place last year, the framework agreement between government and business was simply ignored as it went on a different direction," he said South Africa's unemployment rate jumped to 29%, the highest joblessness rate since 2008. WATCH: Prepare for mass job losses, Ramaphosa warns Shingange says the government's announcement to cut jobs in State Owned Entities was almost encouraging retrenchment and that this communicates a message to the private sector that it is not wrong to retrench workers "They are now talking about retrenching 30,000 employees through early retirement and cutting 10% of the employees' salaries."
