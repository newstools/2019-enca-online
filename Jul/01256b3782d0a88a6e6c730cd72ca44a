ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule labelled Hanekom a charlatan working to divide the governing party. Hanekom's political future is now up for discussion at this weekend's NEC Meeting. The ANC says it will reflect on the matter because it may not only be Hanekom who allegedly colluded with the opposition.

"Look this is one of the topical issues, I think even though the agenda is set by the officials and the NWC this one is a current issue am definitely sure leadership of the ANC either if there is no report, they will have to reflect on it and set the tone for all ANC because it may not only be him who has colluded with the opposition," Legoete said. Now former president Jacob Zuma has also entered the fray, saying Hanekom is a known enemy.
