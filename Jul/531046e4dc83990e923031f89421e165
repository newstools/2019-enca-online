The KwaZulu-Natal High Court has ordered the provincial Education Department to build the facility, following an application by AfriForum. The government had initially approved the project in 2007, but almost 12 years later, nothing has happened.

Eleven years later - in 2007 - the project was approved but that was later reversed by then-MEC, Mthandeni Dlungwane. The court has found the community had been prejudiced.
The department must also provide learning material for the 2020 academic year and, it's been ordered to pay the costs of the application. The Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said the department will comply.
AfriForum and the community say they'll continue putting pressure on the Department until the school is finished.
