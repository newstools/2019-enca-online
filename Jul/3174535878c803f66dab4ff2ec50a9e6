A veterinarian was asked to remove the leopard from the Benoni home on Tuesday morning. JOHANNESBURG - A leopard was darted and removed by a local veterinarian from a home in Benoni on Monday morning. The SPCA contacted Dr Cliff Bull to assist with the removal of the animal after they received a call from a resident who had spotted the animal in a garden. "We called Dr Bull to assist us after we received call that the leopard had been spotted in someone's garden harassing their worker and dog," said the SPCA's Serra Gouriet.

Gouriet said it is unusual for a leopard to be roaming around Benoni, as it is a built-up area. "We are not sure where it came from, although we do suspect that it could have escaped from an enclosure that is nearby. At this point, we do not have enough information regarding where it could have come from." The leopard has been taken to an enclosure where it will be evaluated and assessed.
