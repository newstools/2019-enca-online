JOHANNESBURG - The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture continues to hear Estina dairy farm-related testimony on Wednesday. The commission is expected to continue hearing testimony from two of the intended beneficiaries, Ephraim Mkhosini Dhlamini and Meshack Mpaleni Ncongwane. On Tuesday, Dhlamini testified that promises to beneficiaries were never fulfilled. He put former Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, and former MEC of Agriculture, Mosebenzi Zwane, at the centre of the failed Estina Dairy farm project. The project allegedly sidelined the people it was meant to benefit, with the money used to fund a lavish Gupta wedding in Sun City. Zwane has always maintained this was an empowerment project. Ephraim Dhlamini testified at the state capture inquiry on Tuesday about how they were duped by former Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane.
