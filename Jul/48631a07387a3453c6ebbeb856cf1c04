It shows an officer restraining a woman, while another person, supposedly a nurse, draws blood from her. WATCH: JMPD to escort medics to crime hotspots The incident apparently took place at the Douglasdale Police Station. It's thought that the woman may have failed a breathalyser test and been taken to the station for blood to be taken for testing. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says motorist arrested for drunk driving should expect to be breathalysed and have a blood test done. "If one gets arrested for drunk driving you must expect to be taken for a blood test." WATCH: City of Joburg launches new breathalyser Minaar, however, confirmed that an investigation is underway to find out what happened leading up to the blood test in this case. "There is an investigation underway to find out what happened before the blood test in this particular case. Standard procedure is that when you are suspected to be drunk behind the wheel, the officer can do a blood test on the road or at a police station." Watch the full interview above.
