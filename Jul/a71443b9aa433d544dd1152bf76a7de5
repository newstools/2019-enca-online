Chef Mario Barnard says the idea for the restaurant was sparked after he struggled to eat tarantula and scorpion during a trip to Thailand. READ: Insect eating shouldn't bug you, says author "Well it all started when I was on my personal trip to Thailand. I had to eat tarantula and scorpion; it was a bit gooey and I found it hard to eat. "Then immediately an idea sparked that why not do it in powder form and create dishes in a gourmet way, to present it to the people and it made it much easier for me to eat so why not everybody else", said Barnard. Chef Mario Barnard uses worms and other insects in his cuisine. Barnard says the insects are high in protein and adds nutrition to the dishes. "As a sustainable protein source, it adds so much nutrition to the dishes, its huge in protein, the external skeleton is huge in fibre, iron, zink, the ento milk's got more calcium that normal milk, you know it’s just amazing, a true super food." * Watch Tanya Nefdt's story above
