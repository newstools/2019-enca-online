Plenary, National Assembly, 26 June 2019 CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tabled a Special Appropriations Bill in Parliament on Tuesday morning, outlining the key funding of cash-strapped Eskom. President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his State of the Nation Address, said that government would draft the bill, which would allocate R230 billion to Eskom over the next 10 years. According to a special appropriation bill seen by Reuters, government has allocated an extra R59-billion to the ailing power utility, over the next two years so it can service its debt.
