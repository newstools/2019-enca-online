Accountability Now wants her struck off the roll of advocates. READ: ConCourt judgment against PP devastating: Msimang The court found she lied under oath regarding the Reserve Bank and Bankorp case. It's yet another strike in her rocky time in office. WATCH: ConCourt delivers judgment on Mkhwebane vs Reserve Bank The organisation's director, advocate Paul Hoffman, said advocates who commit perjury are not fit people to remain on the roll of advocates. "Essentially, in polite language, the Constitutional Court has said she is guilty of the crime of perjury."
