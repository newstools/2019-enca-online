The rand taking centre stage as it slips to well below R14/dollar. JOHANNESBURG - Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on South Africa's long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) to 'negative' from 'stable'. Fitch said the outlook revision reflects a marked widening in the budget deficit as a result of lower GDP growth and increased spending. This includes support for state-owned enterprises (SOE) like Eskom.

The rand has weakened to above R14/$ on Friday and an analyst has warned it could breach R15/$ in the long term.
The local unit started its decline earlier this week after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on Tuesday tabled a special appropriations bill for Eskom to receive R59-billion from government over the next two years. READ: Moody's: Eskom's bailout credit negative The rand has struggled to make meaningful recoveries since then and weakened as much as 1.5 percent on Thursday to close at R14.08/$ following a report by Moody's warning that the Eskom bailout would be credit negative. Mpho Tsebe, economist at RMB Global Markets research, said that a lower-than-expected GDP figure would result in expectations of a rate cut being moderated. "[This] will be dollar positive but negative for the rand and other emergency currencies." - Additional reporting IRESS
