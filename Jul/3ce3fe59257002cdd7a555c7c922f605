Mandela Day must be a moment to reflect and ask what is the state of our world and where am I in relation to that." "How does what I do today for this 67 minutes or however long you choose to serve contribute to ending human suffering in the world, to bringing about a more just world order or to advance the causes that Nkosi Dalibhunga championed the freedom of the Palestinians, the right to self-determination of Western Sahara and Kashmir; an Africa, united, prosperous and at peace with itself", read the statement.

"This Mandela Day let us rise to the occasion and celebrate our hero through those things that made him great; an unflinching belief in the propensity of all humans to do good, an unwavering determination to stand for justice, an unshakable commitment to end human suffering regardless of where in the world it may be; striving for a united and prosperous Africa and a better world." Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of International Nelson Mandela Day.
