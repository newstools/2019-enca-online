"It's going to be important for the SAPS to be professionalised and provincialised so that we can ensure that those gangsters end up in jail and citizens can live freely," Maimaned continued. Maimane congratulated the neighbourhood safety team for their continued fight against crime. He also called for an increase of visible policing, saying "the four U’s that currently hamper the fight against crime" across South Africa needs to be urgently addressed.
