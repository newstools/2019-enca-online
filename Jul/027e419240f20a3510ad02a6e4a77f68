#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will seek an urgent judicial review of the Public Protector's report. Ramaphosa has decided to take this action under the firm belief that the president is not above the law and similarly, the Public Protector is not above the law.

It is motivated by a determination that the law should be applied correctly and firmly."
