EFF CIC Julius Malema and other party leaders hold a presser at their Head Quarters in Braamfontein. JOHANNESBURG - EFF Leader Julius Malema says the party will be seeking legal advice to try and compel President Cyril Ramaphosa, to act on the Public Protector's remedial action. Malema says Busisiwe Mkhwebane's recommendations on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan need to be enforced. “We don’t support people who don’t comply with the law, comply with the law, public protector says answer questions, you refuse to answer questions,” Malema said. On Monday, Ramaphosa assured Mkhwebane that he's taken note of the findings against Gordhan. However, the president feels it is inappropriate to take disciplinary action against Gordhan until legal processes are concluded. In a statement released on Monday, the Presidency said Ramaphosa has complied with Mkhwebane’s recommendations. “President Ramaphosa said that having considered the Public Protector’s findings against Minister Gordhan as well as the Minister’s challenges to those findings in his review application, it would be inappropriate to take disciplinary action against Minister Gordhan at this point.”
