Antoine Griezmann celebrates after scoring during the Spanish league football match Club Atletico de Madrid against Real Madrid CF at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium. BARCELONA - Antoine Griezmann signed for Barcelona on Thursday after the Spanish champions paid La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid the 120-million euro ($135-million) release clause required to sign the World Cup winner. "The player will sign a contract with his new club for the next five seasons, through to 30 June 2024, with a buyout clause of 800 million euros," Barca said in a statement. The 28-year-old rejected a move to Barcelona last year to sign a new contract with Atletico but announced in May he was leaving the Madrid side, where he has spent the last five seasons since signing from Real Sociedad in 2014.
