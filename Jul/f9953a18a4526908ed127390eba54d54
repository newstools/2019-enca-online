JOHANNESBURG - Denosa has withdrawn its members from working night shift at the Phola Park Clinic in Thokoza. This comes after a safety breach last Sunday. The union has met with management but remains unhappy with the solution tabled. READ: Growing concerns over hospital safety Denosa is taking the health department to task over the lack of safety measures at the clinic. Last Sunday, a man with stab wounds entered the clinic and was followed by the perpetrators who tried to kill him. Gauteng Health MEC, Bandile Masuku says the EMPD will be patrolling around the clinic.
But Denosa has rejected this plan, saying it wants a permanent solution to keep its members safe.
