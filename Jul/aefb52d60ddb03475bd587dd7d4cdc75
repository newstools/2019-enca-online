#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South African singer Johnny Clegg has died at the age of 66 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Clegg was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 but continued to tour and perform around the world. He received the Order of Ikhamanga as part of the national orders in 2012. Clegg's manager Roddy Quin confirmed the legendary musician's passing. Quin said in a statement, "Johnny leaves deep footprints in the hearts of every person that considers him/herself to be an African. He showed us what it was to assimilate to and embrace other cultures without losing your identity. An anthropologist that used his music to speak to every person. With his unique style of music, he traversed cultural barriers like few others. In many of us, he awakened awareness." Clegg is survived by his wife of 31 years, Jenny and their two sons Jesse and Jaron. The legendary SA singer's family request their privacy be respected during this trying time. #DSTV403
