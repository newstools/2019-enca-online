In a rare show of unity, the DA and ANC stood side by side outside the High Court in Port Elizabeth support of the alleged victims. The National Prosecuting Authority is opposing an application forcing the state to give further details on the charges. READ: NPA calls Omotoso's request a 'delaying tactic' Omotoso says he will feel ambushed in his new trial if he's not provided with additional details about the more than 90 charges he's facing. The charges include rape, human trafficking and racketeering. Omotoso's defence team has accused the State of compiling a slovenly-drafted charge sheet but the State has told the court that his alleged victims can't remember the finer details Omotoso wants.
