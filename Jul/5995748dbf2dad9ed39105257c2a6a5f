Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is back in court less than 24-hours after getting a bloody nose in the North Gauteng High Court. JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, will square off against President Cyril Ramaphosa, a mere 24-hours after getting a bloody nose in the North Gauteng High Court. On Monday, her remedial action relating to the so-called SARS rogue unit was found to be nonsensical. Now, she faces the President in the same court but on a separate matter. WATCH: Court suspends PP's remedial actions against Gordhan It's about Mkhwebane's finding that Pravin Gordhan wasn't authorised to approve the former SARS deputy commissioner's early retirement with full pension benefits. The president says he was forced to approach the court because he doesn't want to discipline Minister Pravin Gordhan now, on the Ivan Pillay pension payout saga. He wants to wait for the outcome of the review application by the minister. READ: No bad blood between Presidency, Mkhwebane He says he doesn't think Gordhan's application is frivolous, and therefore doesn't want to take an irrational decision that would be susceptible to litigation. 
According to the President, if Gordhan succeeds in the review application, it would not be lawful to discipline him, as directed by the remedial action. 
The Public Protector has repeatedly argued that her remedial actions are binding and can't be ignored.
