JOHANNESBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma has called a halt to his testimony at the state capture inquiry, for now. After just two-and-a-half days on the stand, Zuma and his legal team cried foul. Zuma complained of unfair "interrogation" as he was quizzed over the appointment of a high-ranking official he allegedly imposed on a state-owned company.

"I have a problem because I'm being made to go through the details...  I'm expected to remember every other detail on the work generally is done by DGs and officials," a flustered Zuma told the commission. Zuma's advocate jumped to his feet after Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo indicated questioning could proceed. "My client is clearly being cross-examined," said lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane.
