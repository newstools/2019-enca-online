While he's been implicated by at least five witnesses, the former president has signalled that he doesn't believe there is any direct evidence against him.
Former Bosasa operations head Angelo Agrizzi claimed Zuma was bribed by his then boss, Gavin Watson, using former SAA board chair, Dudu Myeni.

Sundaram went on to claim Zuma's influence helped secure a sweet deal for ANN7 when it purchased SABC archives.
The government official responsible for a Gupta plane landing at Waterkloof Air Force Base, Bruce Koloane also admitted using Zuma's name to help secure the landing. 
But only two witnesses have directly implicated the former president. Zuma appears unfazed and it seems, he has plans of his own for the commission. 
The former president's testimony has been set down to continue until Friday
