Emergency personnel work at the scene of a mass shooting during the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California. GILROY, California - California police were searching for a suspected accomplice of the gunman who killed three people, including a 6-year-old boy, in a mass shooting at a food festival south of San Francisco. The gunman was shot dead by police officers within minutes of opening fire early on Sunday evening at the three-day Gilroy Garlic Festival. He was identified as Santino William Legan (19), according to CBS News and NBC News, both citing unnamed law enforcement officials. Among those killed was a 6-year-old boy, according to news reports. Fifteen people were injured, but it was unclear how many were shot or otherwise hurt in the crush of bystanders trying to flee, according to police. One person was in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. A second suspect "was involved in some way, we just don't know in what way," Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said, without giving further details. "We have no idea of a motive," he said.

The gunman cut through a fence to evade metal detectors and other security at the festival entrance, police said. Legan, the teenager identified in news reports as the gunman, appeared to post a photograph from the festival on his Instagram account shortly before the shooting accompanied by disgruntled captions. The account only appeared to be a few days old, and was deactivated at some point on Monday morning. Footage uploaded to social media showed festival attendees scattering in fear and confusion as loud popping sounds could be heard in the background. "What's going on?" a woman can be heard asking on one video. "Who'd shoot up a garlic festival?"
