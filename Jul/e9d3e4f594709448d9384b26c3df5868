File: MattelÂ reported a loss of $108-million, compared with a $240.9-million loss in the year-ago period. NEW YORK - Mattel reported a smaller loss in the second quarter, following sales growth in key franchises including Barbie, Hot Wheels and Toy Story 4. The toymaker reported a loss of $108-million, compared with a $240.9-million loss in the year-ago period. Revenues rose two percent to $860.1-million. Sales were boosted by action figures and games linked to Toy Story 4, offsetting a 22 percent decline in sales in the slumping American Girl division that is being revamped. Sales also fell in infant, toddler and preschool toys due to weakness in Thomas & Friends and in Fisher-Price, where results have been dented by a recall of an infant sleeper linked to more than 30 fatalities. Mattel estimated a $30.4-million negative impact on the recall of the Play Sleeper through midyear. Mattel's chief executive, Ynon Kreiz, said Mattel is making progress on a "multi-year turnaround strategy" consisting of lower administrative and manufacturing costs, as well the launching of film department that is making a new "Barbie" movie with actress Margot Robbie. "We continue to execute toward our goal to restore profitability and regain topline growth in the short-to-mid-term, and to capture the full value of our IP in the mid-to-long term," said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Euteneuer. Shares rose 3.9 percent to $13.00 in after-hours trading.
