OUTA argues the money isn't used to serve the public. Speaking on eNCA's News Night, OUTA says it wants the public to be involved in how tax money is spent. "We've got to be responsible because you can never recover from a full blown tax revolt. We want responsible use of tax and responsible tax paying. There are too many gaps being exploited. We need government to listen and its a constant battle," said Wayne Duvendage, from OUTA. "We will fight hard and we'll engage hard," he said.
