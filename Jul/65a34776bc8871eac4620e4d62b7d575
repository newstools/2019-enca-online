eNCA's Moloko Moloto spoke with the public protector. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has ordered President Cyril Ramaphosa to take action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan within 30 days. This after Mkhwebane found that Gordhan, during his tenure as the Commissioner of SARS, established an intelligence unit in violation of the South African Intelligence legislation. She also said that Gordhan must face an ethics investigation at Parliament. Mkhwebane said that the Public Enterprises Minister violated the Executive Ethics Code by deliberately misleading the National Assembly in failing to disclose that he had met with a member of the Gupta family since taking office. She added that the National Prosecuting Authority must move quickly to finalise SARS "rogue unit" case.
