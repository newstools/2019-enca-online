President Cyril Ramaphosa gives a press conference at The Union Buildings on July 21, 2019 in Pretoria, South Africa. JOHANNESBURG – Political parties have reacted to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to challenge Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings in court. Ramaphosa will seek an urgent judicial review of the public protector's findings against him. Mkhwebane found the president deliberately misled Parliament about money he received from Bosasa for his ANC presidential campaign in 2017. The president emphasised his respect for Mkhwebane's office, but says her report is fundamentally and irretrievably flawed'. The Democratic Alliance says Parliament must hold Ramaphosa to account and establish for itself whether he misled it.

"I will request that the President gives assurance that he will not be using public money to defend himself in a matter regarding campaign finance," Maimane said. "He raised enough money for the campaign he can raise the same for legal defense. Let the NPA investigate and let’s determine if there can be a different outcome. Furthermore, my call for an Ad Hoc committee still stands." "Parliament must hold the President to account regardless of who occupies the office without fear or prejudice." The Economic Freedom Fighters, in a strong statement, has called on Ramaphosa to take a leave of absence while Mkhwebane's report is being subjected to a court review. The EFF is calling on the NPA, Parliament and the Hawks to implement the remedial action proposed by the Public Protector.
