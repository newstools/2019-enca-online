Supporters of embattled eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede clashed with police as they marched to demand that she be allowed to return to work. Gumede has been placed on indefinite special leave, while the ANC decides her future. EXCLUSIVE: eThekwini mayor breaks her silence The eThekwini mayor says she is waiting for her leaders to give her instructions. “I’m waiting for my leaders to let me know when I shall resume my duties. It’s important, as we are led by the ANC, to adhere to what it says because at the end of the day we are deployed by the movement. I wish to apologise to those who were awaiting my return after my 30-day leave lapsed, but it didn’t happen," Gumede said.
