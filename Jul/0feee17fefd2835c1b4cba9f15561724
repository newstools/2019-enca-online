Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Ottis Gibson's fate as coach of the Proteas could be decided on 20 July. Gibson is adamant his done enough to keep his job despite South Africa’s poor World Cup performance. "I said this in the media in England if you look at the World Cup in isolation you think perhaps I haven't done enough in what we have achieved over the last 18 months. I guess it will come down to interpretation from Corrie and the hierarchy," he said. READ: Gibson wants to complete unfinished business with South Africa Gibson’s future as coach of the national team remains bleak after enjoying a successful record before the World Cup, which also included memorable Test series wins against India and Australia, it could be the failures at the global cricket showpiece, which could see CSA wield the axe on the 50-year-old. Gibson took over the coaching reigns in late 2017 and might have a strong case of not having enough time to build up a formidable team for the World Cup. The participation of key players in the 2019 IPL, who went to England and Wales under an injury cloud, also didn't help his cause. "When it comes to the IPL I think there is a lot to think about going forward. In planning a World Cup event we need to take all of those things into consideration...again it might be hindsight but if we want to bring the World Cup home we have to look at every aspect", said Cricket South Africa General Manager, Corrie Van Zyl.
