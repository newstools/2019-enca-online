Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says the State may have to adjust its borrowing plans to save Eskom. JOHANNESBURG - Yet another lifeline for Eskom at taxpayers' expense. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says the State may have to adjust its borrowing plans to save the power utility. On Tuesday he introduced a bill to Parliament to pave the way for R59-billion to be transferred to the ailing company over the next two years.

Mboweni said without a bailout from the public purse, Eskom won’t survive the year and won't be able to borrow more money. "As it stands, Eskom is not financially substantial based on the high level of debt and its inability to generate sufficient revenue to meet its operational obligations," he said. READ: Mboweni expects lower tax revenues, higher borrowing this year “We must thus face the reality that a large vertically integrated energy company is an outdated model in a changing industry both domestically and internationally.” But it's taxpayers that will again bear the brunt of this latest bailout. Mboweni says aid is also on the way for other struggling parastatals, including SAA, SABC and Denel.
