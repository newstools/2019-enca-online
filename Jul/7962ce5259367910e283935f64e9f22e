Not even the drought in Makhanda has dampened spirits at the National Arts Festival. MAKHANDA - The National Arts Festival is underway with a crowd larger than ever before but while the arts are celebrated, the water system of the city is under strain. The festival is expected to boost the local GDP by R94-million, even while festivalgoers are asked to adhere to water restrictions.

While hundreds enjoy the non-stop entertainment, the municipality has been working around the clock to construct pipes to connect the east side of the town to the west side to ensure the taps don't run dry.
