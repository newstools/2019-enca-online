Vimbela Zanele and Sigrid Burger of south Africa celebrate after winning the preliminaries stage two schedule match between South Africa and Uganda at M&S Bank Arena on July 17, 2019 in Liverpool, England. JOHANNESBURG - The South African netball team is in for a big payday should they stretch their journey further in the Netball World Cup. South Africa are through to the semi-finals of the global competition after defeating Uganda 67-40 on Wednesday in Liverpool. The Proteas join England, Australia and New Zealand in the last four. Coach Norma Plummer’s side could have secured a bigger winning margin had it not been for a strong middle phase performance from Uganda to narrow the gap. "They always play well and they stick to it. We always knew it was going to be a tough task and we cannot be too disappointed with a 27 goal win....they worked for it and we'll be hoping to get into the final," said Spar Proteas Coach, Norma Plummer.
