Crucial documents have stolen after an overnight break-in at the City of Joburg offices. JOHANNESBURG - Documents have been stolen from the office of the City of Johannesburg's Chief Whip. It follows a break-in overnight. The city's spokesperson, Lucky Sindane, says it's unclear what type of documents were taken. The possibility of an inside job hasn't been ruled out and security guards will be investigated. Sindane said a suspect was seen on CCTV leaving the building with a bag. "There was no forced entry. We are interviewing everyone to see how the person gained access to the building," said Sindane. This is the second break-in at one of the city's offices.
