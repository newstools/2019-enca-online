READ: DA to challenge ANC portfolio nominees Malema says they will abstain when it's required. “We are no longer voting with the DA in all municipalities of South Africa where the DA requires the votes of the EFF,” said Malema, who was speaking at the party's media briefing in Braamfontein. “We will also not vote with the ANC, we participate in the debates, we will make inputs on what could be a possible solution and if anything requires voting, the EFF will abstain from voting.” The DA said that they had expected the EFF’s decision to cut ties with them. DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe said his party turned down the EFF’s request to become full members of the coalition in municipalities they govern. “We believe that would have been problematic since there are too many areas of divergence between their party and ours,” Selfe said. “We regretfully turned them down and they warned that if we turn them down that would be the consequence.” Julius Malema says the EFF will also be cutting ties with the Democratic Alliance and will no longer vote with the DA in all municipalities.
