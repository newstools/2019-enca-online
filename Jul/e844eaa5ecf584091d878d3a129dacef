Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Duduzane Zuma has been acquitted on culpable homicide and negligent driving charges in the Randburg magistrate's court. Magistrate Tebogo Thupaatlase says the state failed to prove its case. In 2014, the businessman was involved in a crash with a taxi, in which passenger Phumzile Dube died. Initially, the National Prosecuting Authority declined to press charges but that decision was reviewed last year after AfriForum announced its intention to institute a private prosecution. Judgment will be delivered on Friday in Duduzane Zuma's culpable homicide and negligent driving case.
