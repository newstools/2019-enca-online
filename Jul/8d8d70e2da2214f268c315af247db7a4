National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise says ill-behaviour cannot be tolerated. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Errant Members of Parliament can expect tougher consequences for misbehaving, that's if National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has her way. Delivering the budget vote in Parliament on Tuesday, Modise said she wants to see unresolved misconduct cases against MPs concluded as soon as possible. Modise has already reported an EFF MP who disrupted the budget address of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan last week. "I have already referred to a subcommittee the physical removal of a member of the chamber in terms of the rules of the circumstances that led to the removal of members during the budget vote debate on Public Enterprises on 11 July," Modise said.

"Protect and respect Chapter 9 institutions or else you are going to be met with protests here and we are ready for anything, the army, your hooligans you call security, we are ready for all of them," said EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Modise says she also plans to report those who play truant from Parliament to the president. Meanwhile, Modise says there has been no decision on moving Parliament to Pretoria – an idea mooted by former president Jacob Zuma in 2017. Modise also cast doubt over the feasibility study, saying Parliament is investigating how and where it was done. eNCA reporter Lindsay Dentlinger has more details in the video above.
