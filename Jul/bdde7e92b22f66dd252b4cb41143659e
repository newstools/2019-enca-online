Former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson is expected to be elected leader of Britain's governing Conservative Party and the country's next prime minister. Courtsesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The former Mayor of London and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a favourite to win the UK’s leadership contest. The announcement is set to take place at about midday on Tuesday. READ: Final hours of voting in race to become British PM But who is Boris Johnson? Pedalling his way up the ranks in a political career spanning 18 years some would argue, getting the keys to number 10 has been a lifelong ambition for Johnson, one he has been waiting and waiting for. But as a politician, he is rather unconventional. “Boris Johnson is much more fly by the seat of his pants, liable to get himself into hot water by saying the wrong thing, maybe not being as well briefed as he might be,” said PoliticsHome editor, Kevin Schofield. A former journalist, Johnson has often got himself into trouble for comments made in articles or in his newspaper column. In the past, he’s sounded off about Africa, using language taken from slavery and expressing what many describe as colonialist views - In 2002 he wrote ‘the problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in charge anymore.’ He’s also rocked the boat by describing Muslim women in burqas as looking like bank robbers or letterboxes.

Despite his faux-pas, Johnson remains popular with the Conservative party membership and he’s promising to leave the European Union with or without a deal by 31 October and that’s likely to go down well with many who voted leave three years ago.
