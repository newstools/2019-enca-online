Blind Cricket South Africa's national team at an exhibition match against the Titans at centurion park in 2018.  JOHANNESBURG – Cricket for the blind is slowly gaining momentum in South Africa. Blind Cricket SA (BCSA) will be hosting its 5th national T20 tournament in September. “We are not nearly at the same level as other countries in the world but that is mainly due to the lack of finances and sponsorship that could help grow the sport," said Blind Cricket SA’s umpire, Taariq Smit.

Current champions, Central Gauteng, will be looking to defend their title after beating Boland by 10 wickets at the 2018 tournament in Tshwane. BCSA uses the same cricket field and pitch as sighted players, the difference being that the boundaries are slightly shorter than normal fields. - Palesa Manaleng
