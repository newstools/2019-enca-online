A climate of fear and intimidation. Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - A climate of fear and intimidation is what emerged from a 2017 work environment survey at the Public Investment Corporation. Worse still, the HR head allegedly tried to change the results. Employees' reluctance to participate sent a message before the survey was even done, so says senior HR business partner, Ramabu Motimele, who's been testifying at the inquiry. “In my view, the organisational climate at the time was not conducive to conduct a climate survey successfully, in light of the strong views from the informal engagements,” Motimele said. “I could also sense personally that something was terribly wrong with organisational climate, notably, apparent extreme fear, general lack of trust. It was just difficult people did not trust each other.” WATCH: More allegations against former PIC CEO Matjila Despite the early hurdles, the survey was conducted with 51 percent of employees participating. It revealed that the PIC was a negative workplace. What was more shocking, was that there was a direct attempt from the HR head to change the results. PIC executive Roy Rajdhar will be cross-examined on Wednesday.
