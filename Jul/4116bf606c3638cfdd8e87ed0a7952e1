The municipality says it would cost too much to protect the toilet sites. Authorities say they’re working hard to ensure they are allocated to those in need. But some residents now want the project demolished for the sake of their safety. READ: Ekurhuleni Mayor denies toilet tender bungling It is a R49-million service delivery nightmare that has come to haunt residents of Mayfield extension 45. “They rape children in these toilets, they throw children away in these toilets,  they steal from people here, so what must happen? When are they going to allocate the structures to us. They said they are waiting for provincial officials and they’ll get back to us but they haven’t," said community leader Walter Nkadimeng. Construction at the site was halted in March last year after a court dispute between residents and the City of Ekurhuleni over who should be allocated a structure. According to Ekurhuleni Human Settlement MMC Lesiba Mpya, demolishing the project would be a waste of money. “Well we have been protecting them, but it’s actually not sustainable to have guards there 24/7 , it’s actually very costly for the city, we have engaged the Ekurhuleni metro police to assist us in combating the vandalism, but I think we have given all as a city to try and bring dignity to that place, but ultimately criminality is criminality it happens on the least expected areas.” The city says it hopes to conclude the projects by the end of this financial year and hand them over to beneficiaries.
