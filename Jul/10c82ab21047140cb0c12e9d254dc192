Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The SANDF continues to patrol crime hot spots on the Cape Flats. Former Western Cape premier and Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille believes the army being deployed in the province is an ANC strategy to gain popularity in the province. READ: 25 murders in Cape Town over weekend, despite army presence “My opinion on the timing of this move is that the ANC thought that by trying to make the province ungovernable while I was still the premier....they thought that by doing that they could win back support for the ANC in the Western Cape,” she said. The defence force has been working alongside police in crime-riddled areas of Cape Town.
