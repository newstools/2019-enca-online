Zimbabwe's Environment and Tourism Minister Prisca Mupfumira is reportedly being held over the alleged disappearance of millions of dollars at the country's pension fund when she was social welfare minister. HARARE - Zimbabwe's Environment and Tourism Minister Prisca Mupfumira appeared in court on Friday facing seven corruption charges linked to the disappearance of $94 million (R1.3-billion) from the country’s pension fund when she was welfare minister. Mupfumira was detained Thursday by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and is the first sitting minister of the ruling Zanu-PF party to be arrested for graft under the new administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Prosecutor Micheal Reza said Mupfumira faces charges of "criminal abuse of duty as a public officer" and that she allegedly took unauthorised loans from the pension fund to buy a luxury vehicle and fund her political campaign. She was fired as social welfare minister by ex-president Robert Mugabe weeks before a military-led coup that toppled the long-time ruler in November 2017. She was reappointed after the putsch, in the new portfolio. READ: Zimbabwe's tourism minister held for suspected graft The ZACC was created during the Mugabe era but was criticised for being ineffective. Mnangagwa appointed a new team on July 15. Critics have expressed doubts over the new commission because it is led by High Court Judge Loice Matanda-Moyo, the wife of army general Sibusiso Moyo who was involved in the coup that ousted Mugabe and is now foreign minister. According to the state-owned daily The Herald, the commission is investigating more than 200 cases of corruption. Mnangagwa has identified endemic corruption as a major contributor to the country’s economic woes and vowed to root it out.
