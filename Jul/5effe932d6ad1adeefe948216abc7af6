LONDON - Britain's ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch said on Wednesday he was resigning after drawing US President Donald Trump's ire for criticising his administration in leaked confidential cables to London. READ:Â Trump calls British ambassador to US 'a very stupid guy' "The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like," Darroch wrote in his resignation letter. "I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador." London has been scrambling to stem the damage caused by the release of confidential cables from Darroch, which in addition to describing Trump as inept also called his White House "uniquely dysfunctional." The leaked cables threaten to complicate London's efforts to strike a new trade agreement with the United States, to mitigate potential damage from Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
