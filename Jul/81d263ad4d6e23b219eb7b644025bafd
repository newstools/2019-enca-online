The fourth instalment in the wildly popular Disney/Pixar series has earned $238.7-million so far in the United States and Canada LOS ANGELES - "Toy Story 4" once again outplayed the competition at the North American box office, raking in $59.7-million in its second weekend in theatres, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Monday. The fourth instalment in the wildly popular Disney/Pixar series has earned $238.7-million so far in the United States and Canada, alongside another $259-million abroad. The film again features the unmistakable voices of Tom Hanks as Woody, the ever-eager but empty-holstered cowboy doll, and Tim Allen as the impulsive Buzz Lightyear ("To infinity, and beyond!"). Far back in second place was "Annabelle Comes Home," the latest in a series of horror films featuring the creepy doll, which opened at $20.3-million. In third place was another debut flick, "Yesterday," a romantic comedy based on a fanciful idea: what if the Beatles never existed? A mysterious global blackout leads the world to forget the Fab Four, except for one struggling singer-songwriter who becomes an overnight sensation by performing the iconic tunes. "Yesterday," directed by Danny Boyle ("Trainspotting," "Slumdog Millionaire"), earned $17-million. Fourth place went to Disney's live-action remake of "Aladdin," at $10.1-million. And fifth spot went to Universal's animated "The Secret Life of Pets 2," at $7.3-million. A re-release of the blockbuster superhero film "Avengers: Endgame" earned $6.1-million for seventh place, but its overall global box office take of $2.762-billion is still $26-million shy of the $2.788-billion earned by "Avatar."
