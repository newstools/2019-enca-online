A specialised unit which includes the flying squad and the dog squad unit will be deployed, said police.Courtesy#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Security officials are leaving no stone unturned ahead of the eagerly anticipated Carling Black Label clash between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates on Saturday.
The match is a sold-out affair with over 90,000 fans from across the country expected to flock to the FNB Stadium in Nasrec. “I think the organisers have done a good job with the entertainment they have organised for a pre-event and as always the message is all about arriving early to expect to load 50,000 to 70,000 people in the last half an hour before an event is impossible," said Stadium managing director, Bertie Grobbelaar.

Those who will be going to the stadium are urged to arrive early. Local community policing forums will help with security while more police officials will be deployed to the Stadium. Heavy traffic is always a major talking point when it comes to such events but Metro Police have plans to try to minimise congestion. “We'll be having undercover officers on duty mingling with the crowds so there will be an added security feature. We will also have a special traffic plan where we have three lanes of traffic coming into the stadium that we get much traffic into the stadium in the shortest possible time," said Johannesburg Metro Police Chief, Wayne Minnaar. "There will be three traffic lanes from Nasrec from the traffic circle as well as from the Sasol filling station side.” READ: Soweto Derby ends in draw There will be no tickets sold at the stadium due to the fact that all the tickets shave been sold out.
