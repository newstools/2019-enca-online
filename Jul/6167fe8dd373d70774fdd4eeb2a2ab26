READ: State capture inquiry adjourns for Zuma concerns to be addressed After just two-and-a-half days on the stand, Zuma and his legal team cried foul.
Zuma complained of unfair "interrogation" as he was quizzed over the appointment of a high-ranking official he allegedly imposed on a state-owned company.
