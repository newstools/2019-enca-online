File: Durban July organisers insist that the event is not in jeopardy and will run smoothly. DURBAN - Vodacom Durban July organisers have rubbished reports that the event is in jeopardy. Gold Circle Racing and Gaming say they are the licensed operators of horse racing in KwaZulu-Natal and not Phumelela Gaming and Leisure.
The Phumelela business is currently undergoing restructuring, resulting in a number of employees going on strike. Gold Circle Racing and Gaming says the strike won't affect the running of the Durban July. Officials have assured enthusiasts that everything will run smoothly.
