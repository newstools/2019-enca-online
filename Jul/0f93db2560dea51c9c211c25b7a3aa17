Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has refused to restore power to areas that have repeated failures due to illegal connections and high levels of non-payment, especially in Soweto. The power utility says it will only restore supply to legal and paying customers in the areas on condition that the community allows safe access to Eskom staff to conduct audits and remove illegal connections. READ: Residents of Soweto owe Eskom approximately R18-billion. “We have spent about half a billion in maintaining our networks and the biggest portion of that half-a-billion is mainly on replacing assets that have failed as a result of these illegal connections or illegal operating of our networks, particularly our transformers and mini-subs [substatations],” said Eskom's Customer Service Senior Manager Daphne Mokoena Mokoena said the electricity issues were not coming from Soweto only, but in areas such as Katlehong, Diespsloot and informal settlements.
