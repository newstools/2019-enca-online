Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Illegal mining has many dangerous consequences, including damage to roads. The Johannesburg Roads Agency has shut part of Iridium Street on the West Rand after longitudinal cracks formed, indicating that a sinkhole is forming. The West Rand is prone to sinkholes and the city says excavations are causing the land to shift. "There is a number of old mines and there is clear evidence that illegal mining is still active and obviously their activities are affecting the stability of the road," said JRA Head of Infrastructure Siyabonga Genu.

He was never found and just around the corner from there, the eNCA news team found another hole. The JRA will now appoint a geotechnical engineer to investigate the damage to the road, and whether it can be saved. eNCA reporter Nqobile Madlala has more details in the video above.
