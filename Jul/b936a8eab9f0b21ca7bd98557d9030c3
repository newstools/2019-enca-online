JOHANNESBURG - Eskom's R59-billion bailout is likely to come at an even greater cost. Experts say the chance of a credit downgrade is high.

In June, Moody's lowered its forecast for South Africa's 2019 economic growth to 1.0 percent from 1.3 percent after it said a first-quarter contraction had dented the government's revenue and policy options. Moody's is the last of the big three international credit firms to rate South Africa at investment grade. How many bailouts has Eskom received since 2015 and just how much has each South African citizen had to contribute to the up-keep of the ailing state-owned power utility?
