WATCH: SABC bailout conditional, says Communications Minister According to BEMAWU President Hannes du Buisson, It's not only the SABC employees who are happy but also the country as the SABC had been struggling for a long time. "It is very bad at the SABC, if it wasn't for the goodwill of the suppliers, the SABC would have been off the air a while ago." The public broadcaster has been struggling to pay debts and facing possible job cuts. Ndabeni-Abrahams says the bailout isn't unconditional. "Finally, government is actively looking at strengthening the South African Broadcasting Corporation. READ: 'Day Zero' looming for SABC "As we reported in the Portfolio Committee last week, we continue to engage with National Treasury on a lasting financial solution for the public broadcaster," Ndabeni-Abrahams said. "To this end, working with the National Treasury, we will in the next 10 days provide a portion of the interim relief and the remaining balance within the next 45 days. However, this is subject to the SABC meeting all the set conditions and requirements. "In this regard, we will work with the Minister of Finance towards an institutional mechanism to support the turnaround effort, and this includes the appointment of the CRO." The SABC will receive a bailout to rescue it from financial ruin. Courtesy #DStv403
