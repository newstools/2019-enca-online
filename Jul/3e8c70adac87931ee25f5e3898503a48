File: Dr James Blair Mwesigwa will spend a decade behind bars after he removed various internal organs, including the brain, kidneys, and tongue, from a dead body in 2013. JOHANNESBURG - A forensic pathologist has been sentenced to 10 years behind bars for stealing internal organs from a dead patient. He was found guilty on six charges.

Dr James Blair Mwesigwa will spend a decade behind bars after he removed various internal organs, including the brain, kidneys and tongue from a dead body in 2013. Magistrate Eric Muhlari said, "a fine or a suspended sentence will not send the right message to other would-be similar offenders and therefore I have decided on the option of direct imprisonment." Mwesigwa claimed he was busy conducting further tests on the body. The court says even if this was true, permission should’ve been sought first.

The defence says the fight isn't over and it will now be petitioning the judge president.
