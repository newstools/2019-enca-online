eNCA's Lirandzu Themba has the story. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Could the arrest of a suspect who allegedly attacked a homeless man in Pretoria bring the police closer to cracking the case of the capital killer? A 40-year-old man is expected in court on Monday to answer attempted murder charges. He was arrested last week. WATCH: Confusion over alleged homeless attacker's release It's been a month since the first body of a homeless man was found. Police have turned to CCTV footage and interrogated possible witnesses to get some answers. While three of the five male victims have since been identified, police say there haven't been any other leads.
According to the case docket, the attack took place at 1am close to the Magnolia Dell Park. WATCH: Man arrested for attempted murder of homeless man It's the same place where two of the bodies of homeless men were found in June. But despite similarities, police insist the case isn't linked to the Capital Killer murders.
