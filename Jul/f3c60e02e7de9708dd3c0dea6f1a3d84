The Balkan country had reported on Saturday the first outbreak at an industrial farm, at another pig breeding farm also near Ruse. All pigs at that farm in the village of Nikolovo were culled.

Bulgaria, a European Union member, has also reported around 20 cases of the disease in dead wild boars, in various regions, including border provinces with Romania. Experts say 500,000 pigs could be culled due to the highly contagious disease that does not, however, affect humans. Bulgaria has mobilised military and police forces to help combat the disease and protect its valuable pig breeding industry. Preventative measures include enhancing traffic control and border points, disinfecting farms and restricting sales of pork and processed meat.
