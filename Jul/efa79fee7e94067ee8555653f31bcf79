The pink meanie is a cannibalistic little jellyfish that's rarely seen in the wild. CAPE TOWN - Ever heard of a pink meanie? Well, it's a cannibalistic little jellyfish that's rarely seen in the wild. The Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town is exhibiting it. The curiously named cannibalistic critter was last stumbled upon in 2017. And this one was also a surprise -- it was bycatch. Looking almost like a pulsating pink plastic bag wearing a tutu, the meanie survives purely on devouring its cousins. The discovery of the jelly has created much excitement at the aquarium. But it's also raised many questions as to how it does what it does.
