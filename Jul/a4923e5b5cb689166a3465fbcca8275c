Former president Jacob Zuma appears before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that is probing wide-ranging allegations of corruption in government and state-owned companies in Johannesburg, on 19 July 2019. JOHANNESBURG – Former President Jacob Zuma’s lawyer Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane dropped a bombshell on his client’s fourth-day appearance at the state capture inquiry on Friday. Sikhakhane told commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that his client will no longer participate in the commission. "Chair, we are here today to say we will take no further part in these proceedings," Sikhakhane told the inquiry.

A number of witnesses at the commission have implicated him in state capture. Zuma halted his testimony earlier this week, saying he felt he was being cross-examined. Zuma’s legal team says the former President agreed to appear before the commission out of respect for the citizens of the country but the team's now chosen to withdraw, citing what they call serious procedural deficiencies.
