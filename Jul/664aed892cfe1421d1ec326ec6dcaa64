Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the "Terminator: Dark Fate" panel during 2019 Comic-Con International at San Diego Convention Center. SAN DIEGO - Arnold Schwarzenegger will be back for "Terminator: Dark Fate" because he is "addicted" to the killer cyborg franchise that launched his career - but it was the return of Linda Hamilton that stole the show at Comic-Con. Hamilton reprises her famous role as Sarah Connor - who she first depicted in the 1984 original, but left after 1991 blockbuster "Terminator 2" - and age does not appear to have slowed her down one bit. Exclusive footage from the upcoming sequel showed an athletic Hamilton leaping from a vehicle to confront two super-powered, shape-shifting robots with an array of weapons including a gun, a bazooka and a grenade. "My name is Sarah Connor. I hunt Terminators," she announces. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton discussed their decisions to return for "Dark Fate," out November 1, in a panel with director Tim Miller and cast newcomers at the world's largest pop culture convention in San Diego.

I'm addicted to Terminator," said Schwarzenegger, who has featured in four of the five "Terminator" movies to date. "Terminator was the movie that really launched my action movie career." James Cameron, who also returns to the franchise as producer for the first time since "Terminator 2," appeared via videolink from the futuristic set of the "Avatar" sequels. He told a whooping audience that his "only caveat" for producing was that Schwarzenegger must return too. Welcome to the day after Judgment Day. Producer James Cameron returns with director Tim Miller for Terminator: Dark Fate.
