Sifan Hassan initially looked to be off the record pace in the rarely-run event but finished strongly to edge the 4:12.56 set by Russia’s Svetlana Masterkova in Zurich in 1996. MONACO - Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands broke the 23-year-old women’s mile world record on Friday when she clocked four minutes 12.33 seconds in a race dedicated to former American runner Gabe Grunewald, who died from cancer last month at the age of 32. Hassan initially looked to be off the record pace in the rarely-run event but finished strongly to edge the 4:12.56 set by Russia’s Svetlana Masterkova in Zurich in 1996. It was a fitting performance in an event named the "Brave like Gabe" Mile. There was a tribute to Grunewald on the big screens at the stadium before the race and once it was underway, Hassan, who moved to the Netherlands after leaving Ethiopia as a refugee when she was 15, was always in control. “I knew I could run fast, but the first 800 was a bit slow, so after that I wasn't thinking it would be a world record,” said Hassan, who took more than two seconds off her previous best for the distance. "When I crossed the line I was so surprised," she added after clocking a 62 seconds final lap. "After you run the last 400 like that, and set a world record, it gives you so much confidence over 5,000m. "I want to double over 1500 and 5,000 in Doha (at the world championships in September) and the way I finished the last 400, it's amazing.”
