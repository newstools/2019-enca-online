Gauteng Cosatu Chairperson Amos Monyela reiterated the union's position that motorists shouldn't be expected to pay for using the province's highways. “Our position has always been the same and consistent that the people of Gauteng don’t deserve to be treated in the manner that they are treated in terms of the user-payer system which is the e-toll,” Monyela said. “We’ve rejected it from its inception and we are still rejecting it now. That’s why we are calling on the minister of finance to restrain himself when dealing with this contentious issue because the people of Gauteng have indicated that they don’t want to pay for their national roads." The union chairperson said, “the minister can’t be using the position that has been given to him as a deployee, if the movement like his inheritance." "It is not his inheritance; this is the taxpayers’ money. We will not have a situation when a person acts like he is a de facto president when he is not a de facto president.” Monyela said Cosatu is calling for the president and the ANC to call Mboweni to order.
