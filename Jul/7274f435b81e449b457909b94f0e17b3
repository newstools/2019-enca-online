READ: 25 murders in Cape Town over weekend, despite army presence There were also several reports of residents being injured in the shootings. The previous weekend when the army had just been deployed there were 25 murders and while the police and army battle it out to bring stability to the gang-ridden areas, hospitals and clinics are under severe strain. READ: Cape residents think the army deployed to wrong place “A multiple bullet wounded person takes longer to manage and impacts on the waiting time of others as they are a priority,” said Western Cape MEC for health Nomafrench Mbombo. "They are the red patients. A costing that has been recently done by trauma surgeons and specialists, found that we spend on average about R25,000 per person excluding the medication, excluding the length of stay and the ambulance." The Health MEC says the ongoing violence is also impacting negatively on the communities’ mental health, with children in particular, being traumatised.
