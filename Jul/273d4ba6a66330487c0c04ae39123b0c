Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A feeding scheme at a Mpumalanga school has been suspended pending an investigation into the deaths of two pupils and the hospitalisation of 10 others from suspected food poisoning. One of the 10 children hospitalised is in intensive care at the hospital but is said to be in a stable condition. Seven-year-old Zamokuhle Mabena's devastated father Silas says he can't believe his child is gone. “On Monday, the school called us to say our child had fainted," he said. Zamokuhle was rushed to the clinic but it was too late. READ: Mpumalanga pupils die of suspected food poisoning Department spokesperson Jasper Zwane says although the source of the poison has not been established, the food which is usually served at the school will be discontinued until the investigation is finalised. “We would investigate the food they are eating but also to understand what might have happened on their way home. "The MEC has also suspended the nutrition programme at the school until such time we receive the report from the department of health,” he said. The devastated families are now faced with the gruesome task of planning the little ones' funerals.
