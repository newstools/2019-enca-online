Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc steers his car during the second practice session of the German Formula One Grand Prix. HOCKENHEIM - Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fastest in practice at the German Grand Prix on Friday, trading places with teammate Sebastian Vettel at the top of the timesheets. The Monegasque beat home hero Vettel by 0.124 seconds in the afternoon session at a scorching Hockenheim, with a best lap of one minute 13.449 seconds. Vettel had been fastest in the morning. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was third in both sessions for Mercedes. The Briton, who leads teammate Valtteri Bottas by 39 points having won seven of 10 races so far, had set his fastest time of the morning on medium tyres compared to the more grippy softs used by the Ferrari drivers. He used the same tyres as his rivals to set his fastest time in the second session, suggesting Ferrari had a genuine, if slight, edge in the hotter conditions of the afternoon. Bottas ended the day fourth. The Finn, fifth in the morning after a trip into the gravel, was half a second off his team mate’s pace. Max Verstappen, fourth in the morning, ended the day fifth-fastest ahead of Haas's Romain Grosjean, whose car had the same specification used for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Canadian Lance Stroll was seventh for Racing Point ahead of Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikkonen. Nico Hulkenberg, who had to stop his Renault with what appeared to be an engine problem but later rejoined, was ninth in the second session. Mexican Sergio Perez rounded out the top 10 for Racing Point.
