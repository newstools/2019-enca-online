After dropping out of university due to lack of funding, Mohlala decided to create his own legacy. In 2013, Mohlala and a group of friends started designing jeans, but they were not making money. Mohlala refused to let his dream die without giving it another try. Skinny jeans: fad or health hazard? “This friend of mine was like Tshepo you really love this, here is R 8,000 and I bought myself fabric and partnered with a CMT in Joburg, it took us about 4 months to make 1000 jeans, because it was a small factory with just two machines", said Mohlala. Mohlala got major backlash on social media last year for calling his jeans Tshepo but has not let the criticism get him down. “The brand plays a very important role in society in making people realize certain things within a society, so for me I think a lot of black people need to start playing a role in creating instead of consuming, consuming, consuming. Let’s build a new generation.” He says he is expanding his business and is working on creating jeans to sell in Mauritius, Amsterdam and the US.
