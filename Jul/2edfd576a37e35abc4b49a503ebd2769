His claim to have been robbed by armed men aroused an international controversy and led to a 10-month ban in 2016 and 2017. Then he received a 14-month suspension from the US Anti-Doping Agency after a prohibited intravenous infusion, caught after using social media to hype the infusion. That ban ended this week.
