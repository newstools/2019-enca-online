READ: Teacher gunned down at Durban school School officials suspect that the criminals wanted to gain access to the strong room but the guards did not have the keys. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu visited the school and says his department is working with police to increase school safety. A month ago, a teacher was killed at another school in the province. "We have are in a difficult position because we remain firm in our position that we will not allow a situation where educators come to our schools armed.
