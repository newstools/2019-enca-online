JOHANNESBURG - There's a report that says Pravin Gordhan illegally established a 'rogue' unit within SARS, while another says the investigative unit was established lawfully. The Public Protector's recent findings against the minister have reignited the debate. The courts are now being asked to decide who's right. READ: Gordhan hits back at Mkhwebane Appearing outside Busisiwe Mkwhebane's offices, Gordhan's claimed there is a conspiracy against him. 
"The law requires us to cooperate with the Public Protector, so we are here, we've given the answers," he said. READ: Gordhan files court papers against Mkhwebane's report Mkwhebane is standing her ground and said, "the establishment of the unit with the approval of Mr Gordhan as the accounting officer was in breach of section 209 of the Constitution in terms of which only the president may establish such a covert information gathering unit.
She has put her neck out, even quoting from the Bible, "and so I will go to the King, which is against the law, and if I perish, I perish."
The battleground now shifts to the courts, which will hear Gordhan's application to interdict the implementation of Mkhwebane's findings.
