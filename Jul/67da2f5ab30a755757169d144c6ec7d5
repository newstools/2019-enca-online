The Presidency says her report fails to take into account issues raised by the President. JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency says it continues to "maintain that there is absolutely no basis on which to ascribe any wrongdoing to the president" in the Bosasa matter. It says it notes Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings with concern. The Presidency says her report fails to take into account issues raised by the President. Mkhwebane has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa misled Parliament about a Bosasa donation.

"The Presidency has noted with concern that the PP's report does not seem to have taken into account the issues that the president had raised in response to her initial section 7 9 notice where her preliminary findings were made. In certain instances the final report reads word for word like the section 7 9 notice and in the area where she speaks about the responses of the president, she seems to dismiss them in their entirety, making no concessions  whatsoever to the response he has given" said Khusela Diko, Presidential spokesperson. "So that is concerning for the president. We continue to maintain there is absolutely no basis on which to ascribe any wrongdoing to the president in this matter and he will study the report and decide what action if any he would like to take," Diko said. The ruling released by Mkhwebane said Ramaphosa had effectively lied to Parliament about a R500,000 donation he received for his 2017 election campaign for the leadership of the ANC. Ramaphosa initially said the R500,000 payment was made to his son for services rendered. He later retracted the answer and clarified that it was a donation to his ANC presidential campaign.
