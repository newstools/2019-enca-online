The member of the Free State Legislature said the premier at the time, Ace Magashule, must have been aware of the financial irregularities but allegedly chose to ignore them. Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Mosebenzi Zwane sold them a pipedream. So says an intended beneficiary of the failed Estina dairy project who was testifying at the state capture inquiry. A culture of fear prevails after one beneficiary was murdered, allegedly for being vocal about irregularities in the failed scheme.

Dhalmini said while they were promised they would be majority shareholders in the project, there was nothing on paper. The project allegedly sidelined the people it was meant to benefit, with the money used to fund a lavish Gupta wedding in Sun City. "We were happy with it and we thought it would yield good results, but others were suspicious because of the fact that [Vrede mayor John] Motaung was part of the meeting." A promised training trip to India for farmers was reportedly used for other purposes.

"And what happened is they didn't even stay for long there cause they ate chilli sauces or whatever there and then they got sick, they had runny tummies," says Dhlamini, as relayed by the translator. Zwane has always maintained this was an empowerment project. A second intended beneficiary will testify on Wednesday.
