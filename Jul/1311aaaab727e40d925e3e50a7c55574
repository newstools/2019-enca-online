ATM President, Vuyolwethu Zungula addresses claims that Ace Magashule and Jacob Zuma helped start the party. #Dstv403 PRETORIA - ANC veteran Mavuso Msimang said the party needs to deal with Secretary-General Ace Magashule. Veterans are accusing certain party members of trying to divert attention from corruption.
"We think it is more important that they deal with issues for instance where the Secretary-General Ace Magashule is accused untested of having participated in the formation of a party in the run-up to the elections," said Msimang.
