The municipality has failed to pay workers their salaries on time. Samwu says it's also outraged third parties such as medical aids and funeral policies are failing to honour their obligations, despite deductions being processed. READ: Salaries in doubt for workers at cash-strapped municipalities Samwu Deputy General Secretary Dumisani Magagula says the union is pushing for a change of policy in the way local government is structured. “That is why we are going on mass action as Samwu because we have raised these issues over and over again, so we are pushing for a change of policy,” Magagula said. “In August we are going out to the different provinces.”
