JOHANNESBURG - The allegations made against former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) CEO Dan Matjila just aren't letting up. Matjila took the stand at the PIC inquiry on Monday after being heavily implicated in wrongdoing by over 70 witnesses. Then, another bombshell was dropped by UDM leader Bantu Holomisa. Holomisa -- who has been vocal about the goings on at the PIC -- has written a letter to the Commission of Inquiry. This time, he claims he's in possession of an internal PIC report about Matjila. WATCH: Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila's day of reckoning The document apparently claims Matjila received a favourable loan from the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank of over R2-million, something he allegedly failed to disclose to the PIC. Matjila's denying receiving any loan from VBS. Meanwhile, Matjila’s much-anticipated testimony got off to a slow start, with issues around missing annexes. He's clarified the role of the PIC chairperson, who's also the Deputy Finance Minister. Matjila's expected to deliver a marathon testimony, as he’s scheduled to be on the stand until Thursday.
