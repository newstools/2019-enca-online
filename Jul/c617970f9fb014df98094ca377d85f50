A forensic investigation is under way into two KZN municipalities involving the use of hundreds of millions of rands. DURBAN - A forensic investigation is under way into two KZN municipalities involving the use of hundreds of millions of rands. Also being investigated are allegations that officials and councillors are benefiting from water tank installations in the drought-stricken region. The uThukela District and Alfred Duma municipalities in Ladysmith are facing serious allegations of grand-scale looting, fraud and corruption.
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) authorities have confirmed the forensic investigation into both municipalities.
Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka is insisting on a thorough investigation.
"Those who will be found not to comply with the legislation, they will be subjected to a process that will be defined at that time," said Hlomuka.
Both municipalities say they welcome the investigation and will cooperate.
Cogta says criminal charges against those found guilty of wrongdoing will be determined by the outcome and recommendations of the investigation.
