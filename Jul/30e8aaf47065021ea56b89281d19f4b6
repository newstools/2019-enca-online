The EFF’S Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the Public Protector should not explain her reports to Parliament. CAPE TOWN - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has categorically denied waging political battles from her office. Mkhwebane appeared before Parliament's Justice Committee on Wednesday, questioning the motives of members of the executive who have publicly attacked her office.
Mkhwebanewas peppered with questions on her investigations. But she was defended by the EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.

"We operate in a political space, but as an office we are never influenced by what is happening," she said. "I need to assure members that, as I indicated in my opening, that we check what happened, what are the facts, what should have happened, what are the prescripts applicable -- especially the prescripts what the law is saying -- what the constitution is saying and our findings are purely based on that."
The committee is yet to deal with a request from the DA to discuss Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office.
