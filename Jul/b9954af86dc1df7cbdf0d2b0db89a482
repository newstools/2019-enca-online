LONDON - British lawmakers gave outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May a standing ovation as they applauded her out of the House of Commons chamber after her final, at times emotional, appearance as leader on Wednesday. May appeared to be fighting back tears as she left, stopping to shake hands with the speaker, John Bercow, on her way out. She will officially hand over to her successor Boris Johnson later on Wednesday.

Praising the link between lawmakers and the constituents they represent as "the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy", May's voice quivered as she finished: "That duty to serve my constituents will remain my greatest motivation." The hour-long session, which her husband Philip watched from the public gallery, saw lawmakers from across the political divide pay tribute to May's public service and sense of duty, despite voicing their disagreement with many of her policies.
