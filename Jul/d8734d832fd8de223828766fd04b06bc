South Africans must brace themselves for mass job losses. JOHANNESBURG - South Africans must brace themselves for mass job losses. This is a warning from President Cyril Ramaphosa, who admits government has done little to improve the lives of the majority. “Many more people are going to lose jobs," said Ramaphosa. "And they’ll lose jobs because of technology, globalisation, climate change and a whole number of challenges like low economic growth, as we have seen, in our own country,” he said.

The president promises what he calls “a skills revolution” as part of the solution. Meanwhile, nearly 10 million South Africans remain unemployed and are waiting.
