However, it may be a while before Moyo is able to resume his duties. The South Gauteng High court ruled he should be reinstated with immediate effect. Old Mutual is planning to appeal the ruling.

An application for leave to appeal only suspends the final judgment and this is an interim judgment and it does not apply, if they want to suspend the judgment, they ought to go to court to get an order to suspend that.”
