File: More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after 346 people died in two crashes. NEW YORK - Boeing announced some $6.6-billion in additional costs because of the 737 MAX crisis, further pressuring profitability as the global grounding of the plane following two deadly crashes drags on. Boeing said that second-quarter earnings would be hit by $4.9-billion in one-time after-tax costs to compensate airlines for disruptions and plane delivery delays due to the MAX grounding. Profits will also be weighed down by another $1.7-billion in costs due to the 737 MAX's lower production rate, the company said in a statement after the stock market closed.

There is still no firm timetable to bring the planes back into service. "We remain focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service," said Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. "This is a defining moment for Boeing. "The MAX grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognized this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks."
