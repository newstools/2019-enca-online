#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service is aware of the trouble taxpayers are experiencing in trying to file tax returns online over the past two days. The revenue service says the problem arises when users save their income tax return, immediately re-open the return, and then press the tax calculator button before the form has fully rendered. SARS adds that multiple clicks to try to view the return – aggravates the problem. It says it's putting in a fix, where all buttons are “greyed”, or inactive, while the form renders.
