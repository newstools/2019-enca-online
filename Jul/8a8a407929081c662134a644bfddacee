The amount is an increase of just under R1-million compared to the previous financial year. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala delivered his office’s budget in the Pietermaritzburg Legislature on Thursday. Zikalala says Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is an important unifier in the country. “This is sufficient for the current financial year and we will be working to ensure that it is utilised effectively,” Zikalala said.

But other parties are having none of it. The staggering amount comes from taxpayers and the DA has slammed it as ludicrous. “It’s high time where a king can reach a point where he can be independent and leave outside of coffers of public funds,” said DA KZN leader Zwakele Mncwango.

Zikalala says the provincial government is resuscitating the much talked about Royal Household Trust to generate revenue for the king and the royal house to be self-sustainable.
