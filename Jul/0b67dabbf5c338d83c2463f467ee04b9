Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Black Management Forum has slammed the appointment of Nico Bezuidenhout as Chief Executive Officer of the state-owned low-cost carrier, Mango airlines. " Nico signed off two financial statements in 2011 and 2012 which misrepresented his own qualifications. Therefore we are quite surprised that why would they bring a person whose integrity and ethical standing is in question to lead an organisation of Mango's size," said Black Management Forum President, Andile Nomlala. The BMF says the appointment of what it terms a 'white male matriculant’ was outrageous.

"For the first time in the history of state-owned enterprises, you find a CEO's advertising spec saying that Matric is a minimum requirement... all senior positions in government need a degree at the very minimum," he said. "We have written to parliament... we want them to do the same similar probe that they did with Ellen Tshabalala who was the chairwoman of the SABC. They must do that probe to prove that is there any prudence in this gentleman's ethical standing to lead a state-owned enterprise," Nomlala concluded.
