Gumede was forced to take 30 days leave after being charged with fraud and corruption.

If no decision is made, Gumede is expected back at work. 
ANC KZN spokesperson, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said, "a team had been set up and the team is busy doing its work currently, and we believe before end of the 30 days is up the team will have to come and do a presentation to a PWC and subsequently to the PEC and then only after then will a decision be taken."
The party disbanded its eThekwini structure which Gumede was chairing but her supporters continue to pressure the party.

eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza has now become a state witness in the case against Gumede. Whether the ANC will be able to meet the deadline or whether Gumede will return to work remains to be seen.
