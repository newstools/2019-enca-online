File: The United National Transport Union says government has failed to safeguard infrastructure and is doing nothing about safety on trains. JOHANNESBURG - At least one transport union believes the army should be deployed to the country’s rail system, as the police seem unable to cope. The United National Transport Union says the rail network is a national asset that should be protected. READ: Mbalula has grand plan for transport The union adds that government has failed to safeguard infrastructure and is doing nothing about safety on trains. “The mandate of the police services is quite clear, they have to protect the civilians of this country, and currently they do not have the capacity to do that,” said Untu's Riefdah Ajam. “The SANDF, in particular, has been called in to protect and safeguard the assets of this country, and currently those assets are deemed within the jurisdiction of Prasa, Metrorail. “We are having too many and too free access to the platforms through the current infrastructure that we have.” WATCH: Travelling in a Gautrain vs Metrorail Untu and Fedusa have embarked on a one-day strike but it seems to have had little effect on the rail service. The unions say the public transport system isn't safe for workers or commuters. They have handed over a memorandum at Parliament outlining a list of grievances.
