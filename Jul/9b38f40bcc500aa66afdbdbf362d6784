File: President Cyril Ramaphosa's office says he's studying the Public Protector's report that declares him guilty of breaking the executive ethics code. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday the Public Protector's finding that he deliberately misled Parliament about donations to his party election campaign was "unfortunate" and "deficient both factually and in law". "It is unfortunate, however, that from a cursory reading of the final report, it seems that the President's response to the Section 7(9) notice has not been given due consideration," Ramaphosa said in a statement published by the Presidency. The ruling released by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said Ramaphosa had effectively lied to Parliament about a R500,000 donation he received for his 2017 election campaign for the leadership of the ANC.
