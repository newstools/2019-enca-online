Britain's Queen Elizabeth II welcomes newly-elected leader of the Conservative party, Boris Johnson during an audience in Buckingham Palace. LONDON - Boris Johnson took office as British prime minister on Wednesday after an audience with Queen Elizabeth, a moment that put an avowed Brexiteer in control of Britain's exit from the European Union for the first time since the shock 2016 referendum. The queen requested he form an administration. His formal title is now "Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury". Johnson enters Downing Street at one of the most perilous junctures in post-World War Two British history -- the United Kingdom is divided over its divorce from the EU and weakened by the three-year political crisis that has gripped it since that referendum. READ: Brexiteer Johnson to be Britain's PM One of Britain's most prominent Brexit campaigners, Johnson has repeatedly pledged to leave the European Union by 31 October -- "do or die" -- and to inject a new optimism and energy into the divorce, which he argues will bring a host of opportunities. But his Brexit strategy sets the United Kingdom up for a showdown with the European Union and thrusts it towards a potential constitutional crisis, or an election, at home.

Prime Minister Theresa May left Downing Street after a three-year premiership that was marred by crises over Brexit. She formally tendered her resignation to Queen Elizabeth. May appeared to be fighting back tears as she was applauded out of the House of Commons chamber. Her finance minister, Philip Hammond, resigned.
