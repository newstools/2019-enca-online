Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - A South African designer is making waves using African culture and 21st-century chic. Homegrown Shandis creates and sells locally produced outfits, but with a twist drawing inspiration from traditional African blankets. READ: How to beat the cold (and keep your budget at bay) 27-year-old Scelo Mabuza has found a way of keeping a touch of home, everywhere he goes.
He designs and sells outfits made from traditional African blankets known as amatshali.
In his latest creation, Mama Kea, he is turning the blankets into takkies. Each colour has a different meaning and through social media, Mabuza has been able to elevate his brand. He counts occasions where he has dressed celebrities like Kwesta as proof of the brand's growth and success.
Mabuza turned his dream into a reality and believes more can be done if
government invests in budding entrepreneurs to give the economy a much-needed boost.
