The North Gauteng High Court ruled that the public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebana's remedial action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan be suspended. Anton Van Dalsen from the  Helen Suzman Foundation spoke on the matter. Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) has again called into question the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office. READ: Casac says Mkhwebane unfit to hold office The North Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of  Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on his urgent application to suspend Mkhwebane's remedial actions against him.
Lawson Naidoo from the organisation said, "it calls into question the rationality of the behaviour of the Public Protector in issuing substantive reports and secondly, in pressing forward defending them in courts when there was very little chance of success in this matter." READ: Public Protector sets sights on SARS The Helen Suzman Foundation has called on Parliament to urgently expedite a vote to remove Mkhwebane from office. "The Public Protector has lost credibility through a variety of court cases. "If Parliament does nothing, the question then arises, what does that do to Parliament's credibility?" Anton Van Dalsen said.
