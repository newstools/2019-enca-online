Tsimba is hoping that SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux, as the new general secretary of Rugby Africa will assist in improving the administrative challenges that the organisation faces.  
 
"The admin is not in good nick there are lots of problems. There is talent but it's just not given platforms tournaments, high-performance programmes to be able to develop and that is something that they desperately need," said Timba.
 
St Alban’s recently hosted a Moshati rugby festival that includes teams from Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Eersterus. Tsimba then passes on talented players to traditional rugby playing schools. "Once we identify them we signal other schools who can intake these boys so that they can enhance their rugby cause the level we play at is a high level and that if we get some of these boys at that level it makes this programme this project very successful," he added.

With former players like Tsimba getting involved at grassroots, it’s only a matter of time before the much-needed professionalism spreads throughout the continent.
