Georgia Hall of Great Britain poses with the trophy after winning the 2018 Women's British Open Golf Championships at Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club, north west England, on August 5, 2018. LONDON - Prize money for the women's British Open will rise by 40 percent to a total prize pot of $4,5-million, organisers the R&A announced on Monday. The winner of this year's tournament at Woburn will pocket $675,000 (R9,5-million), up from the $490,000 Georgia Hall earned from winning last year's tournament. "We recognised that more needed to be done to elevate the prize fund for this great championship and are pleased that we have been able to make a significant increase this year as part of The R&A's commitment to women's golf," said chief executive of The R&A, Martin Slumbers, in a statement.

A total prize pot of $10,75-million is on offer at the men's Open Championship at Royal Portrush later this month with the winner claiming $1,89-million. "This is an important first step and we know it will take time to move closer to achieving parity with the men’s game," added Slumbers. "We will continue to work toward the long-term goal of a sustainable business model but we can't do it alone and the support of fans, sponsors and media are all key to achieving that success."
