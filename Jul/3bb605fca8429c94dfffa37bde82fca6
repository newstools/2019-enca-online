Could the Constitutional Court judgment against the Public Protector be the final nail in her coffin? Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Parliament is currently considering whether to probe Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office while one institute wants her removed as an advocate. The Constitutional Court found Mkhwebane acted in bad faith when she investigated the South African Reserve Bank's bailout of Bankorp. READ: Calls mount for Public Protector's head Mkhwebane has dug her own grave and the majority of Constitutional Court justices buried her and that's why the court wants her to pay 15-percent of the cost order against her, personally. But, the Public Protector still believes her work was above board. The Institute for Accountability in South Africa now wants the Legal Practice Council to institute disciplinary action against Mkhwebane and strike her off the roll of advocates. eNCA reporter Moloko Moloto has more on the story in the video above.
