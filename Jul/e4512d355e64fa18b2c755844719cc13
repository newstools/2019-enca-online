Ephraim Dhlamini says people wanted him silenced after he spoke about the rot taking place behind the scenes. "They said we must be killed because we are making the other people involved in the project aware of their rights," Dhlamini testified.

Dhlamini said if you speak about the dairy project or Former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane you "won't sleep at your house that night". "People tell us that we should be killed, but we are not scared of them." In 2018, one of the Vrede Dairy Farm intended beneficiaries was found dead.

But rather, he was wrapped in blankets and then placed on his bed to make it look like he was sleeping. Both Zwane and ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule have been implicated. A new witness is expected to take the stand later on Wednesday.
