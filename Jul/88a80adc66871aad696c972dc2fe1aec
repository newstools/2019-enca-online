JOHANNESBURG - The Ndlovu Youth Choir have once again flown the South African flag high following their latest performance on America's Got Talent. The choir, originally from Limpopo, took to social media to announce that they had made it to the shows live round. "Never in our most amazing dreams did we think this could happen, we are through to the @agtlive rounds! Hollywood here we come!!!", read the caption. WATCH: Ndlovu Youth Choir wow AGT Judges AGT judges, including Simon Cowell, had nothing but praise for the choir who performed Shakira's 2010 hit Waka Waka. "I always love seeing you guys perform, I don't know what it is but if I could bottle it then I would drink it everyday," said Cowell. The group will be performing live in Hollywood, a stage in the competition which is often referred to as the “semi-final stage”. In June the choir received a standing ovation from the judges and audience as they sang Vicky Sampson's My AfriKan Dream.
