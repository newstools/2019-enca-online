Batchelor was been laid to rest in Johannesburg on Thursday after he was gunned down in a suspected gang hit last week. Friends, family and those who knew the former lanky striker in the footballing fraternity gave the troubled footballer a fitting tribute.

"His real friend didn't know this guy but the truth of the matter is that Marc made a lot of bad choices with the company he kept to the business dealings and this caused him to lose contact with many of the people who cared about him the most," said Batchelor's friend Archie Henson. The football fraternity only has fond memories of him. "You know Batch always invited me for a coffee,” said former teammate Mark Williams. Batchelor's family are still waiting for closure, however, as no arrests have yet been made.
