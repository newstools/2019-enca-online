Consumption grew by 50 percent last year while the number of gin distilleries has climbed to 65 from under a dozen in just four years, according to the Gin Box subscription club. It is a lucrative market that young, entrepreneurial South Africans are keen to dive into, experimenting with new flavours using local plants like Fynbos, Rooibos and Marula.

"Before craft gin drinks came around, the gins that we had in South Africa were all imported gins. And they only used international flavours, foreign flavours." "But in South Africa, we have such a diverse ecosystem flora and fauna with so many unique flavours that we can actually make truly unique and very enjoyable gins, locally", said Van Wyk. Although beer remains South Africans favourite alcoholic drink, analysts say both craft and commercial beer has hit a ceiling.
