The nephew of former presidentÂ Jacob Zuma, and the grandson of late statesman Nelson Mandela are among four Aurora directors facing charges. The case relates to environmental and water licence transgressions at the failed Grootvlei Mine. This isn't the first time Khulubuse Zuma and Zondwa Mandela will be in the dock. READ: How will Zuma respond at state capture inquiry? In 2015, the high court ordered that they and two other Aurora Empowerment Systems directors pay R1.7-billion in damages for the destruction of the company's Grootvlei and Orkney mines. It had cost about 5,300 workers their jobs. This time, the quartet is facing charges including environmental damage at the very same Grootvlei gold mine. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse is accusing Aurora of violating its water and mining licence agreement, by not draining the acid out of the mineshaft, leading to water sources being polluted.
