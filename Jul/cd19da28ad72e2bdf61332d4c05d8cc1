The ANC is dismissing the EFF claims that Derek Hanekom and Solly Mapaila planned to oust former President Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says there's no evidence to back up claims made by EFF leader Julius Malema. Malema has accused ANC members Derek Hanekom and Solly Mapaila of planning to oust former president Jacob Zuma with the EFF. Mabe says if the claims are true, the pair will be disciplined. WATCH: President Jacob Zuma resigns Malema claims that they had a list of ANC members who were ready to leave the ANC if Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma beat Cyril Ramaphosa in the race to become party leader. Mabe said these are serious allegations. "We will not know whether what is being said is factual or not at such time [when] things that have been said have been tested, confirmed or refuted.

The only thing lagging is that they [media] are not giving me details of what has been said," said Mabe. "There is not any form of a transcript. "It is preemptive of us to conclude on the details of a meeting we were not part of," Mabe said. EFF leader Julius Malema made sensational claims about senior ANC and SACP members plotting with his party to remove former president Jacob Zuma. It appears the ANC is brushing off EFF leader Julius Malema's accusations.
