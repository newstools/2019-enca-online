South Africa's Rope Skipping team. They are currently in Norway representing South Africa in the 2019 World Jump Rope Championships. JOHANNESBURG - A team of five athletes representing South Africa in the 2019 World Jump Rope Championships have set the bar high for themselves. The games will be held in Norway from 3 to 12 July 2019. Led by Keo Mokolopo, a silver medalist in the Individual Single Rope Freestyle in last year's World Jump Rope Champions, the team hopes to go through to the Grand Finals. “We hope to win two medals, go through to the Grand Finals in two events and finish top 10 in the speed events,” said Mokolopo, who's doubling as an athlete and a coach for the team. Rope jumping currently isn’t an Olympic sports and even if it was it is fairly unknown in South Africa. “We have the athletes but we don’t have sponsorship for them to get to such events. For instance, China has over 80 Jumpers this year while South Africa only has five,” says Mokolopo. The team was selected from the Gym Games, camp trials and the athlete’s performances at last year’s international events. It is made up of Keo Mokolopo, Sonopo Tshilwane - a bronze medalist at the 2016 FISAC/IRSF World Rope Skipping Championship, Mkhululi Gosa, Buyisile Hubela and Malusi Tumtumana. By Palesa Manaleng
