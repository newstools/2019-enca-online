File: While incumbent minister Tito Mboweni could retain his position, other potential candidates are being mooted. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will get a bailout of R59-billion from government over the next two years, if Parliament approves it. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tabled a special appropriation bill in Parliament on Tuesday to help the ailing parastatal, but he said the company's business model had to change. Eskom will receive R26-billion of the money this financial year and R33-billion in 2020-21. WATCH: Eskom will be unbundled, says Gordhan A restructuring officer for Eskom could also be announced later on Tuesday. Mboweni said discussions with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan were at an advanced stage. READ: Eskom technically insolvent “Without major changes to Eskom's business model and financial assistance from government, the company will be unable to meet its obligations for the 2019/20 year. We must thus face the reality that a large vertically integrated energy company is an outdated model in a changing industry both domestically and internationally.” Other bailouts on the cards include that of the SABC, SAA and Denel.
