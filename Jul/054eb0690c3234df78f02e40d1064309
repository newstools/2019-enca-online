Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga has suggested things aren't working as they should in the Public Protector's office. He says there needs to be more consultations within the Chapter 9 institution. "I think there is a lot of things that the office has gotten wrong. For example, I think we should be consulting each other a lot more." WATCH: Court suspends PP's remedial actions against Gordhan "I don't know anything about the Absa report, sitting here as the Deputy Public Protector ... and I think that should've been done better. But I think these are lessons that should be learnt in future for the institution to grow." Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane suffered yet another blow in court on Monday, this time against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria interdicted her remedial action against the minister. Many organisations are now questioning her fitness to hold office.
