Another case against the 40-year-old accused was thrown out of court due to a lack of evidence.

Two men had told police they were attacked by a man with a knife while they were sleeping in February and May. Manusi Mothupi was arrested for the crimes and was expected in court on Friday but his case was struck off the roll. Police had failed to bring Mothupi to the dock within 48-hours of the arrest.
NPA spokesperson, Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane said, "within that docket, there was not enough evidence to place the matter in the roll so hence we declined to prosecute as the NPA..." "It's important to uphold the rights of <the> accused person hence where we see that certain laws have been broken then we will not be enrolling such matters."

Authorities have been at pains to say that the so-called Capital Killer is still at large.
Mothupi is now asking for legal aid.
He remains in custody as police try to verify his address and whether he is connected to any other criminal cases. He's expected back in court on Monday.
