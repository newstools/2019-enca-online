It's been confirmed by the PIC that the Nexus forensic report done internally at the state fund management company is authentic. #eNCA JOHANNESBURG - A report that found what others have not has emerged at the inquiry into the Public Investments Corporation (PIC) on Tuesday. Nexus Forensic Services conducted an internal investigation into the PIC and, among other conclusions, found former CEO Dan Matjila had received a R2-million loan from VBS Bank. It has been confirmed by the PIC that the Nexus forensic report done internally at the state fund management company is authentic. Matjila has denied ever receiving a loan from the controversial bank. WATCH: Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila's day of reckoning Evidence Leader Jannie Lubbe told the commission he has received a letter, including the report from UDM leader Bantu Holomisa and the team will investigate. Forensic investigator Advocate Terry Motau probed VBS in 2018 and did not find the Matjila loan in his report "The Grand Bank Heist". The Nexus document claims Matjila received a favourable loan from the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank of over R2-million, something he allegedly failed to disclose to the PIC. Matjila’s attorney stated at the inquiry that his legal team has not seen the report or been given an opportunity to study it.
