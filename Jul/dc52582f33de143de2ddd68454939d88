Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - It could be weeks, even months before the City of Johannesburg has enough working fire engines to service residents properly. More than 40 fire trucks are currently being repaired. But Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has made a promise to residents. "I was given in writing that the order will be placed today (Wednesday) and delivery will be made within the next few weeks and months because it's a huge order. "I've been told it's an unprecedented delivery of fire engines in the history of a municipality, not just Johannesburg and South Africa," Mashaba said. READ: EMS: Only six fire engines operational in Joburg While the delivery is on the way, the City is hoping to have more of its engines on the road by the end of the week. Only seven vehicles are available for the entire metro in six districts. Last week, a Linden resident was left fuming after a delayed response left his home gutted by flames. The defect in the engines vary and depending on the extent of the damage, it could take up to 16 weeks for an engine to be repaired. "We can assure our residents we will be able to respond to any emergency that may occur in the City of Johannesburg," said EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi.
