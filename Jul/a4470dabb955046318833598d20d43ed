A Limpopo dam is one of the fullest in South Africa, but that's only because the provincial government has failed to get water from the structure to residents. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - De Hoop Dam is currently one of the fullest dams in South Africa. Not because Limpopo has been experiencing good rainfall but because government ineptitude has led to a situation where 5 years after the structure was opened, villagers are still struggling to draw water from it. Instead, the poor and unemployed are forced to buy water daily. READ: Government spent R3bn on De Hoop dam: Zuma Several times a day, 53-year-old Dinalane Maota from the Sekhukhune district of Limpopo, carries a drum to her next door neighbour’s yard to buy water. Maota is an unemployed domestic worker with 2 kids. “Every morning we go to the neighbors with borehole water taps and pay R2 for a 25 Liter container. We buy water to bath, to wash clothes and cook.” Sekhukhune district municipality is about 2 thirds the size of Gauteng province. Mostly rural, the area is water-scarce with a history of droughts and scanty rainfall. De Hoop Dam was hailed as a game changer. With a whopping R3.5-billion price tag, it was officially opened by former president Jacob Zuma, just before the 2014 general elections. But, in the past 5 years, government has failed to build infrastructure that would get the water from the dam to the villages. The dam needs treatment plants and pipes to supply water to residents.
