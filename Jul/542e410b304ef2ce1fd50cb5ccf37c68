Angela Merkel said she was "working through" a bout of tremors that first occurred in mid-June. BERLIN - Most Germans believe Angela Merkel's health is a private matter, a poll showed. The chancellor suffered the latest in a series of shaking episodes this week that have raised questions about whether she should give an explanation. Merkel, who turns 65 next week, shook visibly at a welcoming ceremony for Finland's prime minister on Wednesday -- the third such episode in as many weeks. On Thursday, she broke with protocol and sat at a similar welcome for Denmark's premier. Angela Merkel was seen trembling for the third time in a month during a ceremony in Berlin with Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne. The survey of 4,495 representative voters, which pollster Civey conducted for the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, showed a majority -- 59 percent -- believed Merkel's health was her own business. The chancellor, who has no history of serious health issues, insisted "I am fine" on Wednesday, after trembling at the ceremony to receive Finland's premier, and said she was "working through" a bout of tremors that first occurred in mid-June. But she has declined to give any details about her health. Merkel has led Germany since 2005, making her the longest-serving political leader of a major Western democracy. Now serving her fourth term in office, she does not plan to stand again at the next federal election, due in 2021.
