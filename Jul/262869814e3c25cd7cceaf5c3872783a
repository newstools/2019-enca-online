Former South African National Defence Force head Sphiwe Nyanda has responded to former president Jacob Zuma's allegations. JOHANNESBURG - Former South African National Defence Force head Sphiwe Nyanda claims former president Jacob Zuma is a bitter man. On Tuesday, Zuma accused Nyanda of protecting an Apartheid-era spy, used to infiltrate the ANC. Spy allegations are not new in the movement. ANC leaders have, over the past decade, accused one another of being sell-outs and informants for the Apartheid government. In the past, former president, Thabo Mbeki, also confirmed spy infiltration. WATCH: Zuma claims threat on his life and family Former ANC Treasurer-General Mathews Phosa once accused Deputy President David Mabuza of being a spy. So did former Zuma with Advocate Bulelani Ngcuka. The legally embattled former statesman has now opened a can of worms by alleging that two former Cabinet ministers are spies. Sphiwe Nyanda isn't taking Zuma's words lightly, accusing him of being insensitive and using emotional blackmail to divert attention from his wrongdoings. Zuma, sitting on the hot seat at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry, claims he's had enough of the provocation and now he's telling all. Watch the video above
