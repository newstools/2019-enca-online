File: The SACP says it particularly notes the court's damning findings. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has welcomed the interim interdict granted to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The tripartite alliance member says it particularly notes the court's damning findings, notably that the remedial orders recommended by the Public Protector against the minister are vague, contradictory and nonsensical. WATCH: Court suspends PP's remedial actions against Gordhan Judge Sulet Potterill granted Gordhan the interdict pending the finalisation of a review of Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report on the so-called SARS rogue unit. Mkhwebane wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa to act against Gordhan, who was SARS Commissioner at the time.

The EFF -- which supported Mkhwebane - plans to appeal the ruling.
