Rory McIlroy reacts on the 5th tee during the first round of the British Open golf Championships at Royal Portrush golf club in Northern Ireland. PORTRUSH - Home favourite Rory McIlroy made a nightmare start with an opening-hole quadruple-bogey on Thursday as the British Open returned to Northern Ireland and Royal Portrush for the first time since 1951. Organisers the R&A are anticipating the second-biggest ever Open attendance, with 237,750 expected to come through the gates this week, but spectators were left stunned by McIlroy's immediate collapse. The four-time major champion, who fired a course-record 61 at Portrush at the age of just 16 in 2005, was given a huge reception on the first tee as the crowds huddled around the opening hole for a sight of the local hero. However, cheers soon turned to stunned silence and then groans as McIlroy hooked his opening iron shot out of bounds, hitting a watching fan and reportedly breaking her mobile phone in the process. The world number three then pulled his second shot from the tee into the rough, had to take a drop after finding an unplayable lie next to the green and two-putted to post an eight on the par-four first. McIlroy's misfortune continued as he missed a birdie putt on the par-five second and carded another bogey on the third to drop to five over after just four holes.
