The Brandvlei Correctional Centre in the Western Cape wants to become completely self-sufficient. WORCESTER - The Brandvlei Correctional Centre in the Western Cape wants to become completely self-sufficient, and it's well on its way. The facility produces its own milk and butter at an on-site dairy which also acts as a skills-hub to inmates.
Just a short distance away, prisoners are tilling the soil for new crops. They produce enough to service the facility while any surplus goes to neighbouring areas. 
The bakery even got a visit from new Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola. Plans are now afoot to acquire an abattoir so that the prison can produce its own beef.
