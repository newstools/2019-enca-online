Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A Pietermaritzburg mother has found her missing child's body in a pile of garbage, metres away from their informal home. The 13-year-old special needs pupil was kidnapped on Sunday before she was murdered and possibly raped. Sinegugu Dlamini had been playing outside their home at the Jika Joe informal settlement on Sunday. By 2pm that afternoon, there was no sign of her and residents launched a search. On Tuesday morning, when Sinegugu should have been preparing for the first day of the school term, Phumeza Dlamini made a disturbing discovery. "When I was done taking a bath, I went out with the bucket and the baby followed me to the river where we throw the dirty water,” Dlamini said. “On my way there I kept looking. I even looked near the toilets. When I looked at where I was about to throw the water, there was Sne. I screamed and someone heard me and alerted the neighbours, telling them to come out."

Angry residents chased him through the settlement but, in the process, one of them was electrocuted and killed by the maze of illegal electricity connections. Dlamini says the suspect had approached her just over a week ago, looking for a place to stay. The community, which has staged protests, believes police moved too slowly to save the girl, a claim the SAPS has denied. eNCA reporter Dasen Thathiah has more details in the video above.
