LONDON - Britain's Prince Harry has spoken of the "unconscious bias" of racism, saying some people did not realise their own prejudices and that stigma was handed down from generation to generation. In an interview he conducted with conservationist Jane Goodall for British Vogue magazine, Harry also suggested that he wanted to have only two children with his wife Meghan. The discussion between Harry and Goodall about the impact of upbringing and environment on people's views appears in the September issue of the magazine, which was guest-edited by the prince's wife.

"I’m not saying that you’re a racist, I’m just saying that your unconscious bias is proving that, because of the way that you’ve been brought up, the environment you’ve been brought up in, suggests that you have this point of view – unconscious point of view – where naturally you will look at someone in a different way."

Harry and Meghan's first child, a son called Archie, was born in May. "I’ve always wanted to try and ensure that, even before having a child and hoping to have children …," Harry said before Goodall interjected: "Not too many!". Harry replied: "Two, maximum! But I’ve always thought: this place is borrowed. And, surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation."
