Former President Jacob Zuma will come face-to-face with the Deputy Chief Justice at the state capture inquiry on Monday. JOHANNESBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma will finally make an appearance at the state capture inquiry from Monday to Friday. He was forced to appoint the commission by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela after she'd investigated the Guptas' alleged influence on him. But Zuma insists there was no state capture.

Zuma was unhappy that Mandonsela took away his powers to appoint a judge who would preside over the Commission of Inquiry, and gave them to the Chief Justice. On 13 December 2017, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Zuma's application to review Madonsela's remedial action and ordered that he personally pay the costs.
