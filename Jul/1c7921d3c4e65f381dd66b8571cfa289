Thirteen of the dogs died a cruel and painful death, while a local animal rescue managed to save the rest. On seeing the plight of the dogs, Jessica Naudé from the JBay Animal Rescue Sanctuary and her colleagues jumped into action. They administered activated charcoal and Diomec immediately, managing to save more than 20 dogs. Ocean View residents say they won't open a case at the police station because of fear of retribution.
