Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The scrapping of e-tolls is finally on the cards but Gauteng motorists will have to wait a few more weeks before the Transport Minister decides what to do. Fikile Mbalula is expected to report back on e-tolls by the end of August. WATCH: Outa anticipates the end of e-tolls "There is a demand on the table that we are responding to that we must scrap e-tolls. If we do away with e-tolls, how do we overcome those challenges so it's a hard debate, it's robust." “With all the constraints we are looking at the issues and we will give the report to cabinet, and the President and the citizens, it’s not a one-way process. We have to engage with the stakeholders and then we’ve got to engage with everybody. It’s not next year, August we will be back.” WATCH: Makhura to meet Mbalula over e-tolls Sanral is owed around R11-billion in unpaid fees.
