Over the past five years, the Gauteng economy attracted R199-billion of foreign direct investment and 469,000 new jobs were created, Makhura reported. This was a result of joint effort and collaboration between government and business. "We want to work together to build a Gauteng province where no one goes to bed hungry, where the economy reflects the full diversity of the population," said Makhura. Makhura bemoaned the rising, persistent economic inequality and stated the government seeks to eradicate it through the transformation of land and buildings to marketplaces and assets. He also stated his intention to formalise illegal artisanal mining in a fresh way to make sure miners don't break the law.
