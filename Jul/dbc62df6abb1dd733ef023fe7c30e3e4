The City of Johannesburg's emergency medical service currently has only six functional fire engines, far too few for the entire area. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg's Emergency Medical Service (EMS) has confirmed that it's in "dire need of more resources", as it currently only has six functional fire engines. WATCH: Cause of fire at KZN Education Department building unknown Johannesburg EMS spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi confirmed that the city doesn't have enough fire trucks, as most are being repaired. "The reason being, that most of our fire engines are spending more time at the workshops," he said. To address this situation, Mulaudzi said fire engines have been placed strategically in high risk areas, but acknowledged that this did not address problems with lengthy response times. "We want to reassure our residents that the matter about the shortages of fire engines is receiving attention from the highest office in the city." The city announced earlier this year that 28 state-of-the-art fire engines had been purchased at a cost of almost R200-million. "It [the current shortage] was made worse by the withdrawal of the supplier [of fire engines] at the last minute and we had to start the process of procuring new fire engines again." Mulaudzi said he wasn't able to confirm when the new fire engines would be bought and the city would have to manage with its current the resources in the meantime. Watch his full interview above.
