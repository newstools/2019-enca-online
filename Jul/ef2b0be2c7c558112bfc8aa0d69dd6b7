A foggy memory and denials characterised day two of Jacob Zuma's testimony at the state capture inquiry. JOHANNESBURG - Former South African President Jacob Zuma denied on Wednesday having interfered with the appointment of a chief executive at Transnet during his third day testifying at a corruption inquiry. Transnet, which operates railways, ports and fuel pipelines, is one of a handful of state-owned firms that became embroiled in corruption scandals during Zuma’s tenure. WATCH: Transnet deals under scrutiny at state capture inquiry Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan told the inquiry that Zuma had told her at a meeting in 2009 that Siyabonga Gama was his “only choice” to be CEO of Transnet. Gama was at the time subject to disciplinary proceedings because of procurement irregularities, and Hogan said Transnet’s board of directors wanted to appoint another candidate it deemed better qualified for the job. Asked whether he had told Hogan that Gama was his only choice for Transnet CEO, Zuma told the inquiry: “It couldn’t be like that, we don’t work like that. As I say there was a process. … I would have been undermining the process.” READ: Hogan implicates Zuma in no holds barred testimony Zuma has so far ducked and dived at the inquiry, which he agreed to set up during his final weeks in office. Gama eventually became Transnet CEO in 2015 and was involved in allegedly corrupt contracts worth tens of billions of rands to procure locomotives. Gama, who was fired last year after trying unsuccessfully to halt his removal, was not available for comment. He has denied the allegations against him. Transnet has sought to recover via the courts money it says was misspent under Gama’s leadership. Zuma has long denied any wrongdoing.
