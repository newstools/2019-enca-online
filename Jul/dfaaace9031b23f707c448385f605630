WATCH: SANDF deploys another task team to Mozambique Lieutenant Colonel Tiisetso Sekgobela is the SANDF's first-ever woman to command a fighting battalion in peace enforcement operations in the DRC. It's a badge of honour she wears with pride. "I believe that if you are passionate and loving what you doing on a daily basis, it's possible. For me, it is for my daughter to see nothing is impossible. As an African woman, as an African child, you can dream and reach whatever you want. Definitely, more women are needed in these types of situations."

Conditions in South Africa are a far cry from their theatre of operation."
