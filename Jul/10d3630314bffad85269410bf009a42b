The Maritime Safety Authority says the spillage was contained to the water and isn't expected to reach the beach or islands. The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries says there's no need to panic.
Departmental spokesperson, Albi Modise said, "what we can say with confidence at the moment, is that there has no sea left affected by the spillage." "SABSA and the department are working on this matter. We will be monitoring the solution."
