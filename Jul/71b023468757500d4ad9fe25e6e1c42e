Herve Renard is the only coach to win the African title with two countries. CAIRO - Morocco coach Herve Renard is anticipating a "tough game" against South Africa Monday at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt on Monday. While Morocco were deserved 1-0 winners over the Ivory Coast in Group D -- considered the hardest of the six -- South Africa were lucky to lose only 1-0 to the west Africans. "South Africa have a lot of very good players," said Renard, the only coach to win the African title with two countries. "They also have a good coach in Stuart Baxter so it will be a tough game." Although Morocco won by only one-goal margins against Namibia and the Ivory Coast, they have exhibited class and appear to be keeping plenty in reserve for the knockout phase. The goal that sunk the Ivorians demonstrated why the Atlas Lions are considered one of the biggest threats to hosts and bookmakers' favourites Egypt. Nordin Amrabat displayed dribbling skills rarely seen in this tournament and his clever pass freed scorer Youssef En-Nesyri, who had timed his dart forward perfectly. South Africa have been poor both when losing to the Ivory Coast and scraping a win over Namibia with Baxter lamenting the "slowness of transitions from defence to attack".
