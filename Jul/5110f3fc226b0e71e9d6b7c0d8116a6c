The parents of a six-week-old infant, who died under mysterious circumstances at a Soshanguve clinic, are still waiting for answers. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Baby Bohlale died under mysterious circumstances in 2017, at just six-weeks-old and almost two years later, her parents have no closure. They often recall the good memories they shared with their little girl. Karabo Mboyane had taken Baby Bohlale to the clinic for a routine immunisation but things took a turn for the worst. The young mother says her little girl was still breathing when she took her back to the clinic but says staff there didn’t help. While the parents are still waiting for forensic results, the health department says there are serious issues at the testing labs. The country only has two big national laboratories in Johannesburg and Cape Town, to conduct high-level testing.

For families the long wait for forensic results is agonising. "I just want justice for my baby,” said Baby Bohlale’s mother Karabo Mboyane. “I want the results as soon as possible. I cannot wait for five to ten years. I need closure for this. “Five to ten years it’s too long, I cannot wait for that. It’s only going to take me back to the trauma”. eNCA reporter Masego Rahlaga has more details in the video above.
