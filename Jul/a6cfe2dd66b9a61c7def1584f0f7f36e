EFF members  tried to disrupt the minister from speaking and it is believed some members physically threatened Gordhan. The red berets have now been removed from the building. Belinda Bozzoli of the Democratic Alliance tweeted from inside Parliament saying, "Outrageous attempt to prevent Minister Gordhan from speaking in Parliament by the EFF. Intimidation by shouting and then actually approaching the Minister and physically threatening him. All thrown out, but this was a disturbingly Fascistic event.
