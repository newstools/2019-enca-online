JOHANNESBURG - New Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says his department is bolstering efforts to fight crime and corruption. It’s found R37-million in its budget to fund the new Investigative Directorate within the National Prosecuting Authority. “So within the department, we had to look at creative ways to help the department,” said Lamola. The Special Investigating Unit is also receiving the necessary support to claw back money looted from the state. Lamola says two key appointments at the NPA give him renewed hope in the fight against corruption. They are Shamila Batohi as NPA head and Hermione Cronje to lead the Investigative Directorate. “The investigative directorate will pursue all matters that emanate from the commissions of inquiry namely SARS, PIC and the allegations into state capture,” he said. Regulations for a special tribunal of the Special Investigating Unit will also be published soon to recoup money looted from the state. But there are constraints, namely resources and a moratorium on appointments. The NPA has a 20 percent vacancy rate. Lamola is also currently having to consider around 300 parole applications at Brandvlei Prison. He says the 37 percent overcrowding in prisons is a challenge to providing a safe and secure environment for the country’s more than 162,000 inmates.
