Zuma says Rupert told this to Fikile Mbalula and asked him to relay the message to the former president. "One day, comrade Mbalula attended an activity at the farm or home of Rupert and when he saw him he said: 'Minister Mbalula, if Zuma removes Gordhan, we'll shut down the economy of the country. You must go and tell him.' And indeed Mbalula came and told me....'we'll make the rand flat on the ground," said Zuma who was testifying at the state capture inquiry.
