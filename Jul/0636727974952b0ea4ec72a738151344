Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Drug abuse remains rife in Cape Town but a local drag queen and salon owner is doing her bit to help. Chante Herries is an experienced drag queen and finalist in Miss Drag South Africa 2019 but it's her humanitarian work that's bringing in the attention. Herries has taken 15 women under her wing, teaching them the tricks of the hairdressing trade at her Parkwood salon. "I've been seeing so much difficulty with drug abuse, crime abuse, gangsterism taking place in our community and because I also come from a drug-infested house," Herries said. "I would like to teach the girls, hairdressing, beauty and life lessons because when you're a woman, you need to be independent, you need to uplift yourself." WATCH: Youth's battle with drug addiction The fledgling programme is now in its third month. The women will all complete a six-month apprenticeship. Herries is now appealing for donations to start a skills school and with that, give many more people a little slice of heaven. eNCA reporter Leigh-Anne Jansen has more details in the video above.
