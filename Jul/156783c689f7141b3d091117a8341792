President Cyril Ramaphosa has agreed to testify at the State Capture Inquiry if required. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has met the Gupta brothers on three or four occasions. Ramaphosa made this revelation in an affidavit submitted to the Zondo Commission. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on Friday said Ramaphosa wants the affidavit to be made public. READ: Zondo Commission to make Ramaphosa's affidavit public The president said he met the Gupta brothers -- he did not get to know their individual names -- at an ANC briefing in Bloemfontein in 2012. "As far as I can recall, the second time I met the brothers was at a similar event after the 2014 elections," Ramaphosa wrote. Ramaphosa said he never engaged with the Guptas "beyond basic greetings, pleasantries and common courtesies". READ: SA Air Force chief refused Gupta plane landing request He did, however, raise the issue of the landing of a Gupta plane at Waterkloof Air Force Base during a meeting with one of the Gupta brothers and ANC officials. "At this meeting (held in April 2016), various issues were discussed," the affidavit reads. Ramaphosa told the Gupta brother -- who he believes was Tony -- that they had placed former president Jacob Zuma in an invidious position. "Tony Gupta's reaction was that permission for the plane to land had been obtained and given by the Indian High Commissioner." Ramaphosa agreed to testify at the state capture inquiry if it's necessary for him to do so.
