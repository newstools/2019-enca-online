The KwaZulu-Natal ANC member, who was a witness in a murder trial, was gunned down on Sunday night. JOHANNESBURG - Family and friends of a KwaZulu-Natal ANC member who was gunned down over the weekend, are reportedly divided over whether this was a political killing. Martin Sithole was shot dead on Sunday night. He was believed to have been a witness in the trial against murder-accused Newcastle mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba. Sithole’s friend was also killed, while three bystanders were wounded in the incident. Police say that although the motive is not yet known, the case is being handled by the task team investigating political killings. Mahlaba is currently out on R20,000 bail for his alleged role in the 2016 assassination of Wandile Ngobeni, an ANC Youth League leader in eMalahleni. WATCH: ANC says mayors implicated in political killings should go eNCA’s Mawande Kheswa says Sithole’s family don’t know if his murder was linked to political unrest in the eMalahleni area but friends are adamant he was targeted. “From what I gathered from the family is that they never felt that he was in any immediate danger … so this caught them by surprise,” he said. “They (his friends) cited there’s always been tension … according to them, the issue started when he became a witness. They always questioned the fact that he was never guarded … he never had security around him.”
