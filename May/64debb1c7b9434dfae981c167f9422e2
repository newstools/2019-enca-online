City Press senior political journalist Ngwako Modjadji who died on Sunday morning. JOHANNESBURG - Tributes have poured in for City Press senior political journalist Ngwako Modjadji who died on Sunday morning. Modjadji (40) was killed by a speeding motorist in a hit-and-run incident in Soweto. City Press editor Mondli Makhanya said Modjadji's death is a sad loss for journalism. “He was a sharp journalist who spared nothing in getting a good story,” said Makhanya in a statement. "He personified the term ‘intrepid journalist’. Just over the weekend he joined former ANC president Jacob Zuma and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule on a door-to-door campaign in KwaZulu-Natal and managed to interview the former president. “Above all, he was just a magnificent human being. A truly wonderful soul." Political parties and media colleagues have sent their condolences.
