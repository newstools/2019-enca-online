That's the warning salvo fired by EFF leader Julius Malema to lazy party leaders. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema has fired a warning to lazy party leaders, to either shape up or ship out. Malema wants those not adding value to the Red Berets and those being retained due to friendships to go. The EFF grew to just over 1.8 million votes and now has 44 members of parliament but those who Malema regards as lazy leaders should be worried.

"The reality of the matter is that our Chair is a Senior Counsel, forever on consultation, forever in courts and doing those many other tings which are indirectly complimenting the course but it doesn't translate into strengthening the organization, so upon realizing that weakness we said we must zone in," said Malema, who was speaking at the EFF's first briefing after the election where he highlighted the success of his party.
