City of Cape Town councillor, JP Smith said, "when we came into office we set ourselves the goal of deploying one officer per ward, but the budget was never there for it, so the allocations we got were small little allocations or small incremental allocations."
The City of Cape Town plans to beef up on-the-ground resources to fight crime by placing one specialised law enforcement official in each of its 116 wards.

The lone officers are expected to work in tandem with community-based safety initiatives, already in place.
The officers will be recruited and trained over the next six months before being deployed in December.
