KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane said they have opened a case of malicious damage to property. "Over the weekend we had some trucks that were burned down and we have opened a case of malicious damage to property," Zwane said. "We are also warning those people who are intimidating the drivers that they must not do so because that is a crime and those who are doing will also be arrested immediately.” READ: Trucks torched on N3 near Mooi River Plaza The Africa Solidarity Network weighed in on the issue.
