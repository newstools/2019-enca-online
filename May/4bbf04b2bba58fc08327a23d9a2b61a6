Eskom Group Chief Executive Officer, Phakamani Hadebe will step down in July. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Eskom Chief Executive Officer Phakamani Hadebe will step down from his position. The power utility announced that Hadebe, who has been Eskom CEO since January 2018, will leave at the end of July. Hadebe has cited health reasons for his resignation. “It has been a privilege to serve South Africans as the Group Chief Executive (GCE) of Eskom,” Hadebe said. “I am humbled and grateful to have contributed towards the stability for an organisation that is critical for our economy. I am particularly grateful to the Board, the Exco, and all our employees for their resilience and support during this journey.” “It is no secret that this role comes with unimaginable demands which have unfortunately had a negative impact on my health. In the best interests of Eskom and my family, I have therefore decided to step down."

"Appreciating the toll that this takes on an individual, we have had to, with regret, accept his decision.” Hadebe was acting CEO for four months before being permanently appointed a year ago.
