eNCA's Mawande Kheswa has more. #Dstv403 DURBAN - Sewage is pouring into the Durban harbour. The eThekwini municipality is blaming the failure of some of its pumps. As a result, the Transnet National Ports Authority has suspended all diving operations. WATCH: Raw sewage spills on the streets of Vaal Angling activities are also prohibited as the discharge poses a risk to people and marine life. "We've had some minor problems with our rakes that come into the pump station," said water and sanitation consultant Dave Wilson. "[This] allowed foreign objects to come into the pump station which stops the pumps from vibrating and the pumps eventually work themselves to a frenzy and they break down. WATCH: Durban reservoir damage estimated at R50m "Unfortunately, in this instance, we've had four pumps that have gone down."
Government says the threat to people is contained, but marine life might bear the brunt.
