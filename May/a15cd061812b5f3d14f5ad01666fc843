File: Former finance minister Trevor Manuel has taken the EFF to court. JOHANNESBURG - Former finance minister Trevor Manuel has asked the High Court to declare the EFF's statement on the appointment of SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter defamatory. UPDATE: Trevor Manuel's case against EFF postponed The EFF claims he had a corrupt relationship with Kieswetter and that the SARS appointment process, which Manuel chaired, was compromised. Manuel’s lawyers argued in court today that his reputation would continue to suffer if the party is not ordered to withdraw the statement and apologise. The EFF is yet to state its defence and the case will continue on Wednesday.
