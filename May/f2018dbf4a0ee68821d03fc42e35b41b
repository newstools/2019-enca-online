PRETORIA - All eyes are on the IEC National Center in Pretoria. It was expected they explain how the auditing of the result will work. Disgruntled political parties have served the IEC with a lawyer's letter. They are demanding the IEC appoints an independent auditor by 11am tomorrow or they would interdict the release of the results. The IEC is expected to announce the official results on Saturday.
