The parties are disputing the election results. READ: IEC to determine impact of double voting on election This follows among other issues, reports that some people voted twice. "The reason we are dissatisfied with the process is because we have lodged complaints to the IEC based on reports we received from our party agents about irregularities, their response has been unsatisfactory," says Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, from the Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party. "We're expected to endorse this process when later on it can be found that this was a flawed process... This is not the first time the IEC has had this problem. The IEC was found guilty and the Constitution Court ordered a remedy. It has been proven in the past to have been flawed.. Once again we have seen massive flaws in this process which is why we reject this process and we say it is not free and it's not fair," she says. Twenty people have been arrested for double voting in KwaZulu-Natal. The IEC has vowed to investigate these allegations.
