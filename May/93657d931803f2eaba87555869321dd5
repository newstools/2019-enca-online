nalysing Google search trends is a fantastic way to see what's on the hearts and minds of South Africans. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Google has put together search trends that indicate what South Africans have been searching ahead of the national elections on Wednesday. Google SA Communications Manager Mich Atagana says most people want to know whether or not election day will be a holiday. "Is election day a public holiday? is the top question that people have asked. I think most people want to know if they have to go to work after voting, they want to figure out work, life and voting", said Atagana.

"Some of the other trends we are seeing in terms of parties, the three political parties searched for are the ANC, EFF and the DA, as well as their candidates." "So a lot of some of the questions people are asking are folded into political parties that people are searching for."
