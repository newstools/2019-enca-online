Officials will be launching a glove sensor that turns sign language into voice and text. "The expo is to bring the government institutions and the community together in terms of interaction. We have a serious problem in South Africa where there are no systems in place to help hearing-impaired people in terms of communications", said ICT Disability Expo Founder Lucky Netshidzati.

"When you say hi...it translates in a form of a voice and also a form of a text. The reason why we also included is to teach people how to identify sign language in written English. On the data we loaded it also communicates in Zulu, Tswana and Xhosa", explained Netshidzati.
