There's been a slight increase so far in terms of voter support for the EFF. There's been a noted increase in the national results compared to the 2014 general election. JOHANNESBURG - EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu is criticising dozens of political parties who are challenging the election results. He's slamming it as opportunistic attempts as no evidence has been provided. "Those small parties are extremely playful, you must ask them how many party agents did they have.

You can't not campaign and when the results are not showing you want to object to the process." Shivambu said the parties should have objected as the elections were happening. "That there's a problem then and there. Where is the material circumstances that have caused the elections to be not free or fair it's pure opportunism."
