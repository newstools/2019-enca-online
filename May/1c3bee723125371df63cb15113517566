"Only the police are in a position to indicate, but we must say that as the African National Congress that this seriously worries us." Earlier this month, an ANC Youth League leader was gunned down in the province. Dumisani Moyo, the chairperson of Ward 7 of the eThekwini region, was shot dead at his home in Ntshongweni, west of Durban.
