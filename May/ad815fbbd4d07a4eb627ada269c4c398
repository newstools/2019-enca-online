WATCH: Soweto Marathon runners finish strong The Soweto Marathon Trust admits they had logistics challenges in the past, especially around hydration, but say things have become much better since 2014. But 40 000 is a game changer in terms of numbers — but organisers are frank about the challenge ahead. Soweto Marathon Race Director Danny Bloomberg says over the last couple of years, the race has got the water allocations right, and that November is a very hot time of the year. WATCH: Runners ready for Soweto Marathon "We are going to work on the same ratios irrelevant of how many runners we’ve got, so we’re going to apply those same ratios, so from a water perspective and logistical perspective, I think we’re going to copy and paste what we’ve done and make sure that we tick those boxes for our runners.”
