Jofra Archer was left out of the second ODI against Pakistan. SOUTHAMPTON - England left out rising star Jofra Archer as they made changes for the second one-day international against Pakistan at Southampton on Saturday. Team officials had always planned that this five-match series would act as a final audition for places in tournament hosts England's 15-man squad for the World Cup, which starts later this month. To that end, they made three changes to their side following Wednesday's rain-affected no-result which saw just 19 overs bowled at The Oval. Left-arm quick David Willey came in for Archer, fit-again opener Jason Roy returned in place of James Vince -- left out on his Hampshire home ground -- and Moeen Ali was recalled in place of fellow spinner Joe Denly for this day game.

Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed won the toss and elected to bowl first on Saturday. "It looks like a good batting pitch and we want to try and bowl first and take early wickets," said Safraz. "We know it's going to be a high scoring game so we have to be positive. We're hoping we can restrict them to 270-280 and chase the target." Meanwhile England captain Eoin Morgan said: "It looks a very good, fresh pitch. We like playing here -- we have some good memories, and always get some fantastic support."
