Mlangeni, who was imprisoned along with Nelson Mandela after the Rivonia Trial, says if the youth is boycotting voting then who will run the country. WATCH: Politicians cast their votes He says the youth should not be despondent in not being in leadership positions and that their time will come. “It is important they vote even if they don’t into parliament, the time will come for them to get into parliament,” said Mlangeni, who cast his vote in Kenilworth, Cape Town. “They got to learn from us if they are boycotting voting then who is going to run the country when we are no longer there. “It is important because the future is theirs. My time is up. I can’t run the country anymore, I am too old.” WATCH: Election Day weather forecast Mlangeni said that the ANC has done its best for the people of South Africa but believes it's impossible, for government to do everything for free. “Don’t expect that everything will be done for you free of charge, you’ve got to make a contribution,” he said.
