KZN premier Sihle Zikalala appointed him only yesterday [Monday] and already opposition parties are calling for his appointment to be reversed.

You will know that the IFP is an old organisation that is very conservative and will always be allergic to new changes, particularly that will involve young people", said newly appointed KZN MEC, Kwazi Mshengu. The province is battling with poor performance at its schools. "Obviously our target is 80% for 2019 and anything above that for us will be a bonus. We will continue to improve the education system...our ultimate goal is to have 100% pass rate eventually."

"I'm quite aware of what is expected of me and with the experience that I have acquired in the past 11 years in different levels of the public service, I think that will add as an advantage towards the position that I hold now," Mshengu said.
