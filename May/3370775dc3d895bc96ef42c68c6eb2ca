Editor's note: The livestream has ended. You can watch a recording above. JOHANNESBURG - ANC Deputy President, David Mabuza, was sworn in as a Member of Parliament on Tuesday. This clears the way for his appointment as deputy president of the country. Mabuza requested a postponement last week to address the party's integrity committee. The ANC still hasn't given reasons why Mabuza had to appear before the committee.
