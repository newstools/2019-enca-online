Brownell died at the weekend, leaving behind a proudly South African flag that has added much colour to the country. Arts and Culture minister Nathi Mthethwa says the flag has played a pivotal role in building the nation.

"But as a South African patriot, he had a lot of thinking going into the flag, working with other people of course, but the very fact that it’s a flag of convergence, it’s a flag of unity, it’s a flag which is making a statement that we are building a nation," he said. Brownell will be laid to rest this week.
