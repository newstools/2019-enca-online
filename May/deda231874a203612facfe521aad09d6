This follows a push by mine workers to reopen Arnot coal mine after it shut its doors in 2015. A decision has since been taken to reopen the mine and award mine workers 50 percent of the shares.

Now, more than 1000 workers will own 50 percent of the mine. Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe says this is an unprecedented move. “It's a new model in South Africa, nobody ever had faith in it. We tried it before, it's a good experiment to say if workers own an entity, they will be able to take care of that entity. We are hoping this experiment will be a success …that’s why the handing over of the licence was on the May Day so that we highlight the significance of giving ownership,” he said. The mine will provide coal to Eskom. Over a thousand mineworkers have realised a 3-year long dream, to become owners of a mine in Mpumalanga. Courtesy #DStv403
