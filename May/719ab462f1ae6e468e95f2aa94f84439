The African Union says voting happened in a free and fair manner and the claims of irregularities may not have a material effect on the election results. 
"Yyou have in Limpopo four or five stations [that] did not cast the ballots, in KwaZulu-Natal our people noticed there was a problem at one of the municipalities," said head of AU observers, Jakaya Kikwete. "At the end of the day are these five going to impact the results? Certainly, we say no because there are over 100,000 polling stations. "If you had problems in five, you cannot use the five to conclude the elections are bad."

EISA says the claims of multiple votes can't be ignored but they have no evidence of this. 
While close to 30 parties have cried foul over the results, all the observers say their biggest concern is the lack of young people participating in the election.
