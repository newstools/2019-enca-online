Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The EFF has welcomed Cyril Ramaphosa's re-election as the president of the country, but warned the president not to be influenced by outside forces. Malema told Ramaphosa that he won't finish his term if he doesn't heed his warning. "The position you occupy needs someone who's going to be honest with you... those who failed were told many times that they were right even when they were wrong...You must never listen to those who say your are right against the courts," he said. READ: Thandi Modise elected National Assembly Speaker Malema said those before Ramaphosa failed because they were wrongly advised. "Stellenbosch is a problem, we know your proximity...We have not elected Oppenheimer... We told your predecessor we have not elected the Guptas, we elected him and he didn't listen. Listen to the collective wisdom of the people who elected you... Once you listen to white monopoloy capital, you must know that you are likely not to finish you term," Malema said. Ramaphosa will be inaugurated on Saturday, at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. MPs were sworn in on Wednesday in the National Assembly.
