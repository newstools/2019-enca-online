The data from three different polls puts the ANC out in front, but this is a game of margins. In fact, some of the numbers suggest the party could emerge as a wounded winner.

But, they provide some insight into what voters are thinking.
The results of all three polls are based on the assumption of a voter turnout above 70%. The Institute of Race Relations has the ANC just scraping by with a majority, down 11% from the last election, while the DA gains marginally on its 2014 result to reach 24%. The EFF leaps from 6% to 14%.

The DA garners just over 21%, while the Red Berets double their 2014 tally securing 12% of the vote. Finally, IPSOS data shows the ANC cresting the 60% threshold almost on par with its previous election result. The Democratic Alliance weakens its position to under 20%, and the EFF gains, but not by as much as other polls suggest this time managing an 11% share. This time next week the country will be on the eve of a historic election. The data's in and it's good for some, bad for others. But, as they say, a week is a long time in politics.
