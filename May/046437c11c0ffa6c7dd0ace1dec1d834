Ramaphosa's allies were appointed in six of the eight provinces where the ANC governs. READ: Calls for a strong Ramaphosa Cabinet The appointments of Oscar Mabuyane, Zamani Saul, David Makhura, Sihle Zikalala and Stan Mathabatha as premier candidates are seen as a victory for him. Sisi Ntombela and Refilwe Mtsweni are the only female premier candidates - and allied to ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule and Deputy President David Mabuza. The ANC says it is delaying the announcement of the North West premier candidate to appease opposing groups in the province. "There are still reflections in the organisation to make sure that whatever you do in the North West continues to consolidate the unity in that province," ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe.
