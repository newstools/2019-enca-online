Gwede Mantashe speaking on some of the concerns that are raised by the various political parties. Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe says dissatisfied political parties, must follow the right procedure when lodging complaints about the election results. Smaller political parties are unhappy with the election results so far, citing irregularities with the voting process. They are planning legal action against the IEC. "If there are incidents, there are processes and procedures to follow and to deal with them, sit-ins will not resolve them," said Mantashe.
