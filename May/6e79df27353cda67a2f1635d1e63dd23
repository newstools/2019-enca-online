That's how former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka has described the country's time under Jacob Zuma. Mlambo-Ngcuka, who is now Director of Women in the United Nations, says South Africans have to move on and start from scratch. She's putting her cross on the ballot paper next to the ANC. READ: 'Not all was bad under Zuma': Motlanthe “Terrible nine years, that’s for sure but we can move past this. There is no point in looking backwards and we focus on how do we move forward from here.” She was South Africa’s number two at the Union Buildings after former president Thabo Mbeki sacked Jacob Zuma as deputy president. “In last ten years, in particular, I think it has been very challenging because corruption robs us of resources that should be going to the poor. We need to restore the integrity of governance and make sure that the resources which are meant to put children in schools, pensioners, build infrastructure, does exactly that.” WATCH: 'Zuma years destroyed confidence' in investors: Mboweni In contrast to her opinion on the Zuma years, Mlambo-Ngcuka said ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa needs support. “This President needs all the support that we can give him and I definitely want to give him that support.” Mlambo-Ngcuka feels Ramaphosa has to start from scratch with building and reconstructing the country.
