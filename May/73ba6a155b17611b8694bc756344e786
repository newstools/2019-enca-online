JOHANNESBURG - Three of Gauteng's metropolitan municipalities are without water following restrictions implemented by Rand Water this past weekend. The three metros namely, Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane have been hit with a 25% restriction as a consequence of higher than normal demand resulting in average storage capacity dropping below 60% in some reservoirs in Gauteng.
