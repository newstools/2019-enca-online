He's been outspoken about the controversial system. READ: Finance Minister slams Sanral's e-toll decision "I am confident that in Gauteng we will look to a future without e-Tolls. Urban tolling cannot work... to toll a compact and small area like our province creates big problems. The cost is enormous for that," said Makhura. "This has nothing to do with the issue of user pay... it is not a statement against user pay. Urban tolling is like going to Durban every hour and you can't avoid it. The cost on the working people is huge," he said said Makhura. The Premier says he's discussing the issue with the President.
