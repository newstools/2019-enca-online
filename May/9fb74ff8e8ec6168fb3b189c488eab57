Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba says she is yet to see ANC secretary Ace Magashule’s phone tapping allegation compliant on her desk. Magashule’s 'non-existent official complaint' seems to be worrying the spy boss minister. The Minister says the onus is on Magashule to approach the department, and not the other way around. Letsatsi-Duba says it's concerning that the allegations arise just as they’re restructuring State Security. WATCH: Magashule says he has reported spy claims The ANC’s Head of Elections, Fikile Mbalula says party leaders should not be reckless and bandy about wild allegations. “To make allegations all the time that the state is being used, you have to back it up with empirical evidence and not just reckless and undermine the rule of law and then undermine the authority of the state organs," Mbalula said. "So if Mbalula were to make an allegation that my phone is tapped and is tapped by the State, I must be able to, before I open my mouth to the public that I got evidence that points to the fact that the state is following me.” Mbalula adds that it’s unfortunate that Magashule raised these allegations in public, before speaking to the ANC leadership but the embattled ANC secretary-general maintains his phone is bugged.
