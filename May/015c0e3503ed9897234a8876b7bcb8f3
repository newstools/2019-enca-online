Gauteng’s new provincial leaders have been sworn. Taking a cue from the president, Premier David Makhura reminded them they're not in office for personal gain. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he needs Panyaza Lesufi to fight corruption. There’s been an outcry about his removing Lesufi from the Education Department in the province. "Finances are the lifeblood of any government." "The MEC for finance is a key thing in any team of government. We want him to help us expand the envelope of own revenue...we are the only province that has raised its own revenue because we have been expanding the scope," Makhura explained.
