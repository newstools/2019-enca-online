BLOEMFONTEIN - ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has defended party leaders who are implicated in allegations of wrongdoing. While the party's Integrity Commission has instructed compromised leaders to step aside and clear their names, Magashule believes in natural justice. Magashule was delivering a commemoration speech at the 107th anniversary of the late ANC leader Walter Sisulu's birth in Bloemfontein. "Leaders of the ANC must expect allegations against them because they're intended to stop them from moving forward in bettering the lives of our people,” Magashule said.

"Allegations for me, are allegations, allegations are not the truth," he said. "The truth must come out, the truth will be heard, and you guys don't want to accept the universal principle which happens to the entire world, innocent until proven otherwise."
