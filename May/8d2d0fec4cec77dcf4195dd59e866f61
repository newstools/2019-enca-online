He returned and launched himself at Schwarzenegger in a flying kick that sent the star tumbling into the crowd. The man was pinned down and escorted away by security following the report. Schwarzenegger later posted on Twitter that he only realised he was kicked when he saw the video. "I'm just glad the idiot didn't interrupt my Snapchat," Schwarzenegger quipped. He posted a video of himself meeting fans shortly after the incident. Wayne Price, a former professional strongman competitor and Arnold Classic Africa partner, said the man is unknown to the crew and his motives were similarly unknown.

He also served as Governor of California in the United States.
