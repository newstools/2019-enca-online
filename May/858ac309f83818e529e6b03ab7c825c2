JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electorate Commission of South Africa (IEC) has granted Muslim voters permission to apply for a special vote. The Muslim community is currently observing Ramadan. This follows consultation between the Muslim Judicial Council and the IEC. LIVEBLOG: Election 2019 underway The IEC confirmed that it had “granted permission for any Muslim voters to apply for a special vote should they be unable to visit their voting station on [8 May] Wednesday for religious reasons.” These applications, however, are closed. “Electoral staff and polling agents will also be allowed to pray at each polling station and meet their religious obligations,” the IEC added. What is a special vote? A special vote allows a registered voter who can't vote at their voting station on election day to apply to vote on a predetermined day before election day. By law, special votes can only be cast on the dates specified in the election timetable and no exceptions can be made.
