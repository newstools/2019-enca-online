The mayor was arrested for tender fraud on Tuesday morning. Gumede and two-co-accused, including senior municipal official Mondli Mthembu, have been granted bail of R50,000 each with strict conditions. The ANC Youth League in eThekwini has called on Gumede to resign while she defends herself against criminal charges. However, the ANC in the city, says it will give her an opportunity to explain herself to the party. Durban Mayor Zandile Gumede, has been granted R50-thousand bail. Courtesy #DStv403 ANC eThekwini Regional Secretary Bheki Ntuli said that the party needs time to go through the case including the bail conditions and then reach a collective decision on Gumede's fate. “We believe the mayor is still a mayor, as well as a chairperson of the ANC in our region until we sit with her and until we go through all these conditions that have been put through by a court of law,” Ntuli said. “It is a very sensitive matter and we don’t want to rush into conclusion without following all the due processes. “We must be very principled. We understand the public has got an interest in the case, politically it has got some implications as well and it is a matter we must handle with care.” eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and her co-accused have each been granted R50 000 bail. Gumede is in trouble over a multi-million-rand tender dished out in 2016 but there’s no proof of any work done in return for the R208-million spent. The State alleges the mayor-influenced processes to ensure certain service providers were selected. No cameras were allowed in court and Gumede’s supporters didn’t allow any pictures of her afterwards, either. Gumede and 11 other people implicated in this case, are due back in court on the 8 August.
