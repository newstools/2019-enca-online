Figures from Statistics South Africa show increasingly more young people are out of work. The official unemployment rate has now hit 27.6-percent in the three months to March this year and that is up from 27.1-percent in the three months before. The figure is up half a percentage point from the end of 2018.

Most pressing are the millions of young people who are unemployed, regardless of education level and those who have neither jobs nor schooling. An estimated 237, 000 unemployed people lost their jobs in the first quarter of 2019 with the overall number of unemployed standing at 6.2-million and there's been a little good news. “We also have observed that in the area of transport there were gains of 59,000 jobs quarter on quarter but they were not enough to offset the unemployment rate,” Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke.
