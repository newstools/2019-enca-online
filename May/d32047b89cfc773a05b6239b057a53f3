JOHANNESBURG - A private ambulance spotted driving through Windsor has sparked a new wave of speculation that baby Sussex has arrived. The lurking ambulance and a series of other clues including a statement from Kensington Palace suggesting that Prince Harry will be visiting the Netherlands for the Invictus Games next week have fueled gossip. According to Metro UK Harry was not able to commit to the engagement in the Netherlands due to the fact that he was uncertain when his child would be born.

"He'd always planned to go but with the impending birth of his child it wasn't announced in advance in case he was no longer able to attend," said the royal aid. Meanwhile the Duchess of Sussex, who was due to give birth in April, has not been seen in public since March. The couple had previously asked for privacy during this time and said a formal announcement would be made once the family was ready.
