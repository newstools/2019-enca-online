It looks like the marriage between the EFF and the DA will continue. This despite pre-election declarations that the relationship has reached its expiry date. Courtesy of #DSTV403 TSHWANE - The EFF is pushing to appoint one of their members to the position of Tshwane mayor instead of current mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. The party argues that they are in a power-sharing deal with the DA and therefore the blue party will lead in Johannesburg while the red berets will lead Tshwane. WATCH: EFF briefs media post-election "We are not passing any motion of no confidence. This is power sharing," EFF leader Julius Malema. "We are talking to the DA." Malema said they would be supporting Herman Mashaba, the mayor of Johannesburg, who is "tormenting the ANC" but want control of the Tshwane area.
