DURBAN - Several communities are without water in the Durban area after the Mobeni water reservoir collapsed. A statement circulating in the media read that a bombing was to blame for the collapse. KZN Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said she is on site with SAPS members as well as structural engineers. "At this point in time, we have to wait for investigators to tell us what caused the damage to the reservoir. "I'm not sure who had issued the statement. We'll have to check with the municipality," she said. Dube-Ncube said the damage to the reservoir is "quite huge" and that restoration is not something that could be done over a very short space of time. DA councillor Gavin Hegter was on the scene on Saturday morning. He said it was quite clear that the collapse was not a case of the ageing and unmaintained infrastructure failing. "It would appear that it was some form of sabotage," he said. "I find it very strange that the municipality issued a statement that they are investigating the bombing of the reservoir, yet now the city manager turned around and said he never said that." Hegter said a company close to the reservoir sustained millions of rands of damage to equipment. He said the matter should be investigated.
