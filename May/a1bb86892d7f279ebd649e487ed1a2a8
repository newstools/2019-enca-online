It is understood Seamus Lawless went missing after he slipped near an area known as the Balcony. READ: SA celebrates Saray Khumalo as she descends Everest The area, which is part of Everest, is more than 8,000 metres above sea level and that places it close to the so-called 'death zone', a region where the air is extremely thin. Reports suggest that rescue teams are searching for Lawless. Meanwhile Khumalo, who made history on Thursday becoming the first Black African woman to reach the summit, is descending the mountain. She is set to return to base camp at some point over the next 24 hours.
