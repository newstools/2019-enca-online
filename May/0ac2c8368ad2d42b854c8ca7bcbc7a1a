Zuma said in his observation during the election campaign period, parties could not articulate their policies. “You must put your vote where you know there will be something happening, benefits as well as the improvement of the country and not people are shouting better slogans but which party that says that it will deliver a better South Africa, better than others,” said Zuma who voted at Ntolwane Primary school in Nkandla.
