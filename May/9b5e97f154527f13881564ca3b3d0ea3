File: Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africaâ€™s medical staff says Kagiso Rabada is expected to be ready for the World Cup opener. Rabada returned early from the IPL due to concerns about his troublesome back, which has been a recurring problem for the speedster. At the time he said, "It is indeed very hard for me to leave the Delhi Capitals at this stage of the tournament, but with the World Cup just a month away, a collective decision has been made for me in this regard". South Africa are also monitoring the fitness of Dale Steyn and Lungi Ngidi. Fortunately for the Proteas, the seamers have a couple of more weeks to get ready for the World Cup. South Africa open the tournament against hosts England at Lord's on 30 May.
