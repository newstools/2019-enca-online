The DA is begging the electorate not to vote for smaller parties, saying they will band together with the ANC, to take control of the Western Cape. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - DA leader Mmusi Maimane says voting for the ANC is equal to voting for corruption. Fearing an ANC/EFF coalition in the Western Cape, the DA has used Workers’ Day as a last-ditch attempt to keep control of the province. "The best branch of the ANC is in heaven, the next branch is going to be in Pollsmoor Prison not far from here when we put 15-years for corrupt politicians," said Maimane who was speaking at his party's Workers' Day rally at the Hillsong Church in Cape Town.

"If we don’t get over 50 percent, the ANC and EFF together will get over 50-percent. And then this province will be taken from us. Then, corruption and everything that goes along with it will return,” Zille said. eNCA reporter Lindsay Dentlinger has more details in the video above.
