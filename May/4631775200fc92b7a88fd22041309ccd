The company was due to file the motion for summary judgment on Tuesday (Wednesday in China), said Song Liuping, the firm's legal officer, in a statement carried by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. "The bill directly determines that Huawei is guilty and imposed a large number of restrictions on Huawei," Song was quoted as saying.

A motion for summary judgment aims to seek a judge's decision without going to a full trial. "It is hoped that the US courts will declare the Huawei ban unconstitutional and prohibit its enforcement," said Song. The court case comes as Huawei also faces a broader US executive order preventing the use of its equipment in the United States and a more damaging US action to blacklist the company, cutting it off from critical American-made components for its products, though a 90-day reprieve was issued.

The concerns have escalated as Huawei has risen to become the world leader in telecom networking equipment and one of the top smartphone manufacturers alongside Samsung and Apple. The firm's proactive battles in US courts signal it is willing to use all means, including national courts, to prevent exclusion from a race to the 5G market - the future of high-speed telecommunications.
