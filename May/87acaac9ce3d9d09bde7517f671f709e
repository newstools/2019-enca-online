Courtesy of #DSTV403 DURBAN - Questions are being raised about whether the embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede might have violated her bail conditions while presenting her budget. Gumede has been charged with fraud and corruption and is out on R50,000 bail. READ: Beleaguered eThekwini mayor delivers city's budget She tabled the city's R5,6-billion budget at City Hall.
Her bail conditions state she's not allowed to interact with senior staff members and heads of departments in the municipality. It's unclear whether presenting the budget has contravened any of these stipulations.
Opposition parties' plea for Gumede to recuse herself have been ignored.
Gumede also would not respond to reports she's defying her party.
"We are in the budget speech today. I'm doing my work as the Mayor of eThekwini as you can see me and political issues are not forming part of this," she said. "We are in the City and doing the City work."
Neither the Hawks nor the ANC was immediately available for comment.
