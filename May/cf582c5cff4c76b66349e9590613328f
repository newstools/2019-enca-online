US Serena Williams hits a return to Sweden's Rebecca Peterson, during their WTA Masters tournament tennis match on May 13, 2019 at the Foro Italico in Rome. ROME - Serena Williams made a winning return from injury beating Swedish qualifier Rebecca Petersen 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the second round of the Italian Open clay-court tournament on Monday. Williams, 37, has not played since a hard-fought three-set win over Petersen in the second round at the Miami Open in March before withdrawing with a knee injury. The 23-time Grand Slam winner - now ranked 11th - also withdrew from Indian Wells in March complaining through illness.
