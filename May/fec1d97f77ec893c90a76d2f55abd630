The ANC has since announced its premier candidates. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng ANC Deputy Chairperson Panyaza Lesufi has extended his support for Premier David Makhura’s re-election. The ANC premier candidates list has been announced after the party’s National Executive Committee received three names per province as recommended by the Provincial Executive Committees. Makhura has again been nominated to lead Gauteng. “We are quite excited as a province because it’s a continuation of governance,” said Lesufi, who has served as education MEC under Makhura’s administration. “Our people in the province have demonstrated that there issues that they don’t like and they want us to rectify them and the best way to rectify is to continue with the person that is leading us so that we can accelerate, rather than to find ourselves struggling to find somebody who needs to acclimatize and understand the system.” The ANC retained Gauteng with a slim 50.1-percent in last week’s polls.
