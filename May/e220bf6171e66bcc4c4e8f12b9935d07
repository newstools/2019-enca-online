British actor Colin Firth poses upon arrival to attend the European premiere of the film 'Mary Poppins Returns' at The Royal Albert Hall in London on December 12, 2018. FRANCE -Â British Oscar winner Colin Firth is set to star in a new World War II drama as a spy spreading disinformation to protect Allied soldiers mounting raids against the Nazis, its producers told media at Cannes Monday. The highly anticipated film called "Operation Mincemeat" is an adaptation of a Ben Macintyre book of the same name, Variety reported. It is set to go into production this year. The movie is set in 1943 as the Allies plan a multi-pronged assault on Nazi-occupied Europe. Firth, who won an Academy Award in 2011 for his starring role in "The King's Speech", plays Ewen Montagu, who tries to throw the Germans off the trail of the massive Allied invasion force.

Also in Cannes, producers announced that work will begin this year on the thriller "Lair" starring "The Mummy" actors John Hannah, Corey Johnson and Oded Fehr. The film is billed as a "socially conscious horror movie about an LGBT family embroiled in one man's attempt to prove the existence of the supernatural." Cannes, the world's biggest film festival, runs until Saturday.
