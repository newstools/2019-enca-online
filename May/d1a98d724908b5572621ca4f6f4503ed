Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila made over $100,000 (R1,4-million) on the board of directors of Ecobank. This is according to former CFO of the bank's card and electronic banking department Altu Sadie who appeared before the PIC inquiry. LIVESTREAM: PIC inquiry resumes "If you look at Mr Daniel Matjila the director fees were $100-000 a year, he also got a nice benefit for $20 000 which he got for two first-class airline tickets. In most cases these get paid to the organisation and to the person", said Sadie.
