Caster Semenya will have to rethink the rest of her career. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Women's rights organisation, Gender Links is urging Caster Semenya to appeal the IAAF's court verdict. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled the 800m Olympic champion must reduce her testosterone levels before she will be allowed to enter certain races. READ: British runner Sharp received death threats for Semenya comments The judgment means women with elevated testosterone will need to take suppressive treatment if they want to compete in races under the IAAF's auspices. “We have looked at the facts and when you at the facts, it just defies logic,” said Gender Links CEO Colleen Lowe Morna. “In 2009, the IAAF required Caster Semenya take a sex verification test, which she did and she was according to whatever checklist they used, deemed to be a woman. “That is how she has always been.” The World Medical Association is advising physicians against implementing new eligibility regulations for classifying female athletes.
