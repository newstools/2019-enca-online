Serena Williams of the US serves the ball to Russia's Vitalia Diatchenko during their women's singles first round match on day two of The Roland Garros 2019 French Open tennis tournament in Paris on May 27, 2019. FRANCE - One year after her 'Black Panther' catsuit caused controversy, Serena Williams returned to Roland Garros on Monday, dressed in a zebra-striped cape emblazoned with the words 'mother, champion, queen, goddess'. The 37-year-old American wore the Nike-backed black-and-white cape as she arrived on Court Philippe Chatrier for her opening match against Vitalia Diatchenko. The legend of 'mother, champion, queen, goddess' was written in French in a nod to her hosts.

Williams fell foul of Roland Garros last year with her one-piece black outfit which she said she needed to wear to boost her circulation. She had suffered blood clots when she gave birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia. "I believe we have sometimes gone too far. Serena's outfit, for example, would no longer be accepted. You have to respect the game and the place," said French Tennis Federation president Bernard Giudicelli.
