After realising there wasn’t enough material reflecting positive things about black children in Africa, Mkhize felt she had to close the gap. She’s creating a decolonised history of Africa for children, through books. READ: Trevor Noah releases children's version of his memoir "Africa is the origin of humankind so tens of thousands of years of human history began here... it's really terrible if we think what we are going to do when we teach our children is that our lives and pains revolve around what Europeans did... that's an element of the history that's important for them to understand," said History Professor and author, Nomalanga Mkhize. Titled ‘In Africa with Avi and Kumbi,’ the book tells the story of the continent, from ancient times to independence. WATCH: Meet the 11-year-old that has written eight books "In the book, you'll see there are sections on great Zimbabwe. There were big schools or universities thousands of years ago in Africa. It's very important for our children to understand that they must not reference their identity based on what people did to them but on who we are and what we have accomplished in our own African history," she said. "The only limit to this book was the cost of printing. When you write a book like this you need independence to bring in your skills as a professional historian," added Mkhize.
