President Cyril Ramaphosa being sworn in as a member of Parliament at the National Assembly. JOHANNESBURG - Jeff Radebe’s reign as the country’s longest serving minister has come to an end. Bathabile Dlamini and Siyabonga Cwele were also left out. WATCH: Mixed feelings as political parties respond to new cabinet For the first time since 1994, the president’s brother-in-law Jeff Radebe, won’t be serving in Cabinet. He’s held several portfolios over the last 25 years, most recently that of Energy. President Cyril Ramaphosa has also left out controversial president of the ANC’s Women’s League - Bathabile Dlamini. Following her handling of the social grants crisis, and a scathing Constitutional Court ruling to boot, he was under pressure not to reappoint her. Veteran former minister Siyabonga Cwele also didn't make the cut. READ: Cabinet sizes from the past three presidents Neither did former Cape Town mayor and Human Settlements Minister, Nomaindia Mfeketo and Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom. The former labour minister Mildred Oliphant is also out, as is the erstwhile State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba.
