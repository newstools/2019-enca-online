NEW DELHI - Millions of people are living without power or shelter in eastern India, a week after a devastating cyclone hit the region. Reports have emerged of angry survivors protesting over the slow pace of relief. At least 42 people lost their lives in India's Odisha state and neighbouring Bangladesh after cyclone Fani barrelled into the region on May 3, packing winds of up to 200 kilometres an hour. "The destruction has taken place over a very large area. The damage to power infrastructure is unprecedented," Bishnupada Sethi, special relief commissioner of Odisha state, told AFP.

Officials said that power had only been restored to around 50 percent of the one million residents in the state capital Bhubaneswar, while the most extensive damage hit the neighbouring city of Puri, where the cyclone made landfall. Puri, which is home to around 200,000 people, is also one of the country's most important Hindu pilgrimage sites including the ancient Shree Jagannath Temple and the Sun Temple. A team from the Archaeological Survey of India is currently assessing the damage to both the World Heritage monuments.

Even the road and communication network has been restored. All our resources from across the country are deployed on the ground," Sethi said. But local media reports said the situation on the ground remained dire, prompting survivors to protest over the sluggish pace of relief efforts.
