FlySafair announced it would be adding more seats to its annual sale. JOHANNESBURG - Hours after announcing the release of 45 000 tickets at R5 each, the FlySafair website crashed on Tuesday morning. Despite the introduction of the online "waiting room", a holding area that is supposed to allow the random selection of users every five minutes, many customers took to Twitter to report that they were unable to access the site.

Meanwhile the low-cost airline has apologized to customers in a statement released on Twitter and said the system failure is caused by an issue in one of their serves. "While there are over 25 000 people in the waiting room, we are experiencing an issue with one of our servers." "Unlucky customers who hit the wrong server are getting an error. To keep this fair we're going to pause the sale until that server is sorted so everyone gets a fair shot", read the statement.
