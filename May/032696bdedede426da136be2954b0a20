Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - The community of Soshanguve has been left traumatised after a man killed three of his girlfriend's children, before taking his own life. Thabang (11), Amogelang (3) and Lebogang (2) were hanged by Molefe Mojutu before he killed himself, also by hanging. Police are investigating the circumstances that led to the incident. "Preliminary investigations indicated that a man who is 29-years-old took three children from the mother's house," said Police Spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele. "The mother had the impression that he might be taking them to school but only to find that he brought them to his place."

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she later saw police vehicles in the man's yard. “They all looked normal. I went into my house to start cooking and a few minutes later I saw a police van rushing past and I got out to check what is happening," said Mariah Motshwening, a neighbour. "When I asked one of the neighbours they told me what happened.” Police have opened a case of murder.
