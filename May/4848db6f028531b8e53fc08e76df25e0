The graduation season is drawing to a close. With rising unemployment in South Africa, just finding a job can be daunting. JOHANNESBURG - Graduation season is drawing to a close and it will soon be time for newly-qualified professionals to enter their fields of expertise but looking for work is a daunting prospect. Thamsanqa Maqubela, the CEO of the South African Council for Graduates, believes that young graduates may not be fully prepared for the marketplace.

As there is a high rate of cooperative failure in South Africa, the council aims to equip graduates with a toolbox of skills and aids to succeed. Maqubela said, "our universities and colleges are not preparing young people for work."

Maqubela said South Africans cannot sit idle and blame others but rather put mentors in place and open up businesses to equip the youth for self-sufficient business operations.
