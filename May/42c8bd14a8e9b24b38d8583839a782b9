Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Alexandra residents are hoping the Human Rights Commission’s inquiry will yield positive results for better living conditions. The commission is investigating socio-economic conditions in the area, their impact on fundamental human rights and whether it amounts to malfeasance. Alexandra residents brought the township to a standstill last month, demanding better services.

"Grass cutting along the roads is also a problem and it's dangerous and not safe." The Public Protector has joined forces with the commission to investigate the situation in Alexandra. The commission will hear from the Joburg City Manager on Tuesday. eNCA reporter Tshegohaco Moagi has more details in the video above.
