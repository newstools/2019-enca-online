President Cyril Ramaphosa at his inauguration ceremony. JOHANNESBURG - There is still much uncertainty around who will be in President Cyril Ramaphosa's new Cabinet yet social media trends show that Ramaphosa's inauguration on Saturday produced happier South Africans. A Gross National Happiness Index, that looks at what people tweet, claims South Africans are pretty happy. Well-being economist Talita Greyling says data shows that Twitter users were seemingly quite optimistic and happy about the new dawn. READ: Ramaphosa to announce cabinet later in the week "The happiness of Saturday was just marginally high than other Saturdays which means that people's mood were higher than on any other Saturday exactly in the time period after the inauguration", said Greyling. Greyling adds that they used software that uses sentiment analysis in order to measure the levels of happiness following the inauguration. "The software that we use uses sentiment analysis. Now sentiment analysis is also something very specific. It is an old measure which we use text analysis where they could measure the emotion captured in something that has been written."
