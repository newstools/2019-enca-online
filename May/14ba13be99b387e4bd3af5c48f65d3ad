Gumede explained the reason a commission of inquiry has been called for is that there is a siphoning of money from patients' premiums and medical aids are not paying medical administrators who are providing services. Gumede stated the mistreatment by medical aids is felt most harshly by medical providers who are also people of colour. Clinical social worker Nomaefese Gatsheni stated she was one of the victims of mistreatment from medical schemes.
