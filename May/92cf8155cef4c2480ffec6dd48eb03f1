Collectors at a Johannesburg art auction have been painting the town red with their bidding. While it puts a price tag on their hobby, it's also a chance to show their appreciation. #eNCA JOHANNESBURG - South African art prices reportedly grew by 28% in the past decade, compared to the 12% growth globally. Art collector and advisor Kholisa Thomas says although most art is expensive, the love for art usually consumes the buyer and so it is their way of showing appreciation.

It should spark conversation, it should make you reflect on something", said Thomas. Thomas says there is a general misconception that a person needs to have a lot of money to be able to buy art but she says this is far from the truth as there is a market for first time buyers. "Often what we don't talk about is how you can start buying art and how it is so important to support our artists working in the city."
