Sascoc is hoping for a quick decision from Switzerland's Federal Super Court. JOHANNESBURG - Sascoc is hoping for a quick decision from Switzerland's Federal Super Court. This comes after 800m World and Olympic champion Caster Semenya's decision to appeal against a Court of Arbitration for Sport verdict. That ruling, delivered at the beginning of this month, threw out Semenya's challenge of the IAAF's new testosterone regulations. READ: Semenya to appeal IAAF testosterone ruling Sascoc Vice President Barry Hendricks says the process has been frustrating but they will be tolerant and patient with that process. "It is extremely frustrating because we know that the IAAF is trying to deny one of our star athletes of competing in events that she wants to compete in, so we hope that the Swiss courts will handle it speedily.” Semenya lost an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport earlier this month over measures imposed by the IAAF that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes or those with "differences of sexual development" (DSD) to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women.
