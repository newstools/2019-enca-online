File: Steve Hofmeyr has previously ruffled feathers with what many see as racially motivated statements on social media, as well as posting photos of the old South African flag. JOHANNESBURG - Afrikaans singer Steve Hofmeyr has asked South Africans to join him in destroying DStv decoders in response to a decision by MultiChoice to ban his content. In a video posted on social media on Thursday, Hofmeyr cancels his subscription before driving over his decoder and throwing his satellite dish on the ground. He then encourages people to join him in ensuring the 'downfall' of MultiChoice by posting videos of themselves destroying their decoders. VIDEO: Man destroys DStv dish in support of Steve Hofmeyr "Get WiFi, Android TV or many other pay-to-watch platforms. We will see the downfall of MultiChoice in our lifetime. I arranged a special funeral for my dish. I’ve placed a video below," said Hofmeyr in Afrikaans. He then offers to give one person a R10 000 cash prize if they participate in the challenge. "A R10,000 cash prize for your video where you do the same. We’ll choose one lucky winner on 1 June 2019. We’ll inbox the winner, inform him or give his business any publicity that they would want. You must provide proof of your suspended DStv service."
