Olympic champion Michael Johnson believes the athletics world governing body came down on the side of fairness. JOHANNESBURG - Reactions to Caster Semenya's fight against IAAF's decision to restrict testosterone levels in female athletes continues. While some responded with dissatisfaction after the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal by Olympic 800-metres champion on Wednesday, olympic champion Michael Johnson believes the athletics world governing body came down on the side of fairness. READ: Outrage as Semenya loses battle over new IAAF rules "It was always going to be a difficult situation because of no fault of her own, she just happens to have this condition but at the end of the day the IAAF has to make a decision on the line that's drawn between the female races and the men's races into categories. And while it's no fault of Caster Semenya's, unfortunately for her, she will have to make a decision to either start taking the medication to reduce her testosterone levels or not be allowed to compete - and it's a difficult situation to be in but I think the decision was based on the fairness of sports, so that there is a level playing field for all of the athletes in any given race," said Johnson. READ: Semenya's legal team to review ruling The Court of Arbitration for Sport has upheld the IAAF regulations which require women like Semenya, with higher than average natural female testosterone levels, to take medically-prescribed drugs to lower their testosterone levels or be kicked out of competitions. The rule applies to female athletes running between 400 metres and a mile. They could force athletes to undergo hormone therapy if their levels exceed certain limits. Semenya and her legal team are reviewing the decision to dismiss her appeal of the new IAAF rules.
