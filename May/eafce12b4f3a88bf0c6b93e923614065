Township or the suburbs? A decision many parents have to make when choosing a school for their children. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - With the online applications underway in Gauteng, the race is on to secure a place at the province's top public schools. However, one high school in Soweto is proving that top-quality education is a reality in townships, too.

Perceptions of low education standards, overcrowding and understaffing at township schools are just some of the reasons given.

Raymond Mhlaba Secondary School on the outskirts of Soweto in Tshepisong achieved a 100-percent matric pass rate in 2018.

He says a school's biggest resource is its teachers. "I got the best education system that even prepared me for not only university but life,” Manganye said. “It depends on the teachers you have because a learner can be at a private school but doesn't excel or have the quality education." Schools like Raymond Mhlaba Secondary are proving that quality education isn't measured by AstroTurf, tech labs and swimming pools but by hard work and commitment from pupils and teachers. eNCA reporter Slindelo Masikane has more details in the video above.
