Odirile Mafaro was allegedly pushed down a staircase by a 17-year-old boy. His family is now demanding answers from the provincial education department. READ: Cele concerned by school violence Odirile's grandmother noticed something was wrong when he got home on 10 May.
Absalom Motsamai, the boy's father, relayed: "He didn't say anything. He only said there is a boy who beat him up but he didn't explain how." When Odirile spoke up, he said someone had pushed him down a set of stairs at school and once he'd fallen he'd been kicked. When the family reported the incident to the school they were told to take the boy to hospital. Days later, things took a turn for the worse when Odirile lost the ability to move his legs.

The North West Education Department says they are investigating the matter and whether the suspect has been involved in any other incidents. The provincial health department insists the boy was given adequate care.
The suspect appeared in the Koster magistrate's court on Monday and is facing a murder charge.
