The EFF’s Motsamai was released from prison just last year after serving 27 years for murder. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng had the those in the house on the edge of their seats, starting proceedings on a concerned note. “One member who has to be sworn in was convicted and is on parole," Mogoeng said. "I know it’s been a subject matter of debate.” READ: Gauteng EFF says it will be watching ANC closely Mogoeng explained that at least five years must pass after serving a sentence before a delegate can become an MP but, without naming the affected person, the Chief Justice explained the delegate concerned was convicted in 1989, and the provision in the Constitution only came into effect in 1996. “It is for that reason that I will be administering the oath. My reading of the Constitution is that after means after,” Mogoeng said. Motsamai, a former PAC member, joined the EFF last year after it vigorously campaigned for his release. Former Johannesburg mayor and National Assembly MP Amos Masondo was elected unopposed to chair the house. His deputy, former Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas was however heckled from the public gallery over the R50 000 she spent on fast food during the first two months of her premiership in 2013. Seiso Mohai has retained his job as Chief Whip.
