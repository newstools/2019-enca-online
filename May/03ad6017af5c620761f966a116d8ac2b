But he says he wouldn't serve as a minister in Ramaphosa's Cabinet.

I will not allow that," Malema said. It remains to be seen whether those deemed as compromised leaders by the integrity commission, will become MPs. "All the 'constitutional delinquents' shouldn't be in Cabinet. Anyone that has no respect for the oath of office, anyone who's been involved in shenanigans should not be appointed as a minister," he said. Ramaphosa who'll take his oath of office on Saturday, is widely expected to announce his Cabinet on Sunday.
