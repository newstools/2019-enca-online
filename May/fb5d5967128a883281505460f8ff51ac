JOHANNESBURG - With days to go until the Nedbank Cup final between Kaizer Chiefs and TS Galaxy, there are concerns about the state of the pitch at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium. The stadium recently hosted the Monster Jam event, a successful Motorsport production which came to South Africa. While the spectacle thrilled spectators, it left the playing surface in need of repairs. Stadium management’s Vusi Mazibuko says they’re working hard to ensure the pitch is ready. “Preparations for the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday is almost there now. I would say we are 95% ready … We are a multipurpose venue - we have had other events before the final - and now we are getting ready for the final.” READ: List of past Nedbank Cup winners Last season’s Nedbank Cup semi-final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium ended in crowd unrest, as Free State Stars upset Kaizer Chiefs 2-0. Mazibuko is confident authorities will ensure there is no repeat of that mayhem. “The security for the match is not the responsibility of the stadium, it’s the responsibility of SAPS. SAPS have made their arrangements they are going to be making announcements.” READ: PSL head coach merry-go-round Durban will be the hub of entertainment as sports fans and political leaders will descend on the East Coast for the much-anticipated final. “I’m looking forward the president of the Country, Cyril Ramaphosa, also our new premier of KwaZulu Natal is going to be in our Nedbank cup final because it’s going to be beautiful.
