After a week's postponement due to concerns raised by School Governing Bodies and Stakeholders, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is finally launching the online admissions application system for next year's Grades 1 and 8. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng education department can breathe a sigh of relief, as the online school admissions process for 2020, went live on Monday. After a week's postponement due to concerns raised by School Governing Bodies and Stakeholders, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi finally launched the online admissions application system for next year's Grades One and Eight. Lesufi says the issues have been addressed and it’s all systems go. The system has now also been altered to give school suggestions based on race and language. “We don’t use race to place people, we use race just to know how many people have applied that are black, African, so they said remove that part it must be information that is used. We have accepted that as well, reluctantly,” Lesufi said.

Parents are also being urged to watch the tutorial video before applying. “There is a tutorial video that is available on our website, that video takes parents step by step because this is a three-step process. It’s very important that people familiarise themselves with it because when we open there’s no room for mistakes.” Walk-in centres have been set up across Gauteng to assist with online admissions.
