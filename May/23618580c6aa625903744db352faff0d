Zola Tongo is applying for parole in June, almost nine years since Dewani was murdered. EXCLUSIVE: The untold story of Anni Dewani Dewani's parents, Ashok and Vinod Hindocha, are in South Africa to make representations to the parole board. The family still wants clarity on several unanswered questions on what happened in November 2010. Shuttle taxi driver Tongo picked up newlyweds Anni and Shrien from the Cape Town International Airport. He transported them to the upmarket Cape Grace Hotel. If Tongo's version is anything to go by, this is when the plan to kill Anni was hatched. READ: Anni Dewani's family won't give up On 5 December 2010, Tongo signed a plea agreement, pointing to Anni's husband as the mastermind. Two days later he appeared in the Western Cape High Court. Tongo was supposed to be the state's star witness -- the only conspirator to have had contact with British businessman Shrien Dewani. Four years following the crime and after changing his tune several times, the prosecution's case collapsed. Tongo was slapped with an 18-year sentence in return for his full cooperation and testimony against Dewani but that backfired. He will have to wait until the beginning of June to find out whether his parole has been granted.
