WATCH: EFF gaining more ground "Let me say this categorically, I do not agree with the views put forward by the former premier of the Western Cape. The discussion on privilege in this country is a function not only of our history, which advanced a particular race over another but it’s also a function of what the last few years in government have done, which failed to produce opportunity to be included in our economy," said Maimane. In 2018, Zille came under fire for tweeting in defence of aspects of colonialism.
