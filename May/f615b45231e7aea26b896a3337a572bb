Questions are being raised about a possible low voter turnout in today's election. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The EFF has expressed disappointment at how the IEC has handled some issues it encountered. The party says it's not happy with the IEC's response on people who have cast more than one vote. It's reported that some voters have been removing the indelible ink and vote twice. WATCH: IEC to probe alleged instances of double voting The EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the IEC has not been able to respond about a number of claims of people going from voting station to voting station. "People who were registered for special votes pitched up and voted again," he said. "There are important things the IEC can't give you answers as to what they're going to do to reconcile them."
