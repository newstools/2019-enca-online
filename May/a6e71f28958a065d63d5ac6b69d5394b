Authorities have arrested several people in Johannesburg for fraud and forgery. JOHANNESBURG - Police have vowed to keep shutting down illegal businesses following the arrest of more than 80 people in Johannesburg. The arrests were part of police operation Buya Mthetho and included two major busts. In the first incident, police uncovered a fraud and forgery syndicate selling license disc ID’s, passports and number plates from all over the continent. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says it is concerning that there are people who have purchased a license from the business and yet do not have driving skills.

To think people who have no skills to drive a motor car have been able to buy it here is extremely dangerous,” said Minnaar. In Alexandra police removed goods from shebeens which were operating without permits “More than 85 suspects have been arrested for various cases <of> house breaking theft and housebreaking. Also during the operations, there were those arrested for drugs and illegal immigrants we are continuing and we are calling on those doing things illegally that the police mean business”, said SAPS spokesperson Kay Makhubela. Suspects are expected to appear in court soon.
