Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - State Capture Inquiry Chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo wants answers from the Hawks. During the inquiry on Friday a witness said the elite crime-fighting unit was told of a suspect Transnet deal back in 2017. Charted accountant Roberto Gonsalves says the company overpaid for the relocation of a train assembly plant, amounting to 66 times as much to R 647-million. “I would’ve expected a much bigger stronger reaction from executives when approached by shareholders in one of the IOM, there was so much evidence in front of them”, said Gonsalves. WATCH: Transnet information officer testifies at state capture inquiry Zondo has told the commission's legal team to follow up with the Hawks. “The legal team should take steps to be in touch with the head of the Hawks. I want to know what’s happening about this and why should it take so long for the matter to be concluded”, said Zondo. Meanwhile the National Prosecuting Authorities new Investigating Director  Hermione Cronje says prosecutors are keeping a close eye on the evidence. “We have been working quite closely with the state capture commission. The volume of information at the commission has been mind boggling...We have been working with them to analyse and interrogate the data they have.” Proceedings will resume on Monday.
