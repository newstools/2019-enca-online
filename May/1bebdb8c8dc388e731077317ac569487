Today the commission will hear the testimony of former Transnet employee Gerhard van de Westhuizen. WATCH: Former Transnet strategist testifies at state capture inquiry Last week, chartered accountant, Roberto Gonsalves, told the commission the Hawks were alerted of a suspicious Transnet deal. He said the deal rose from R9,7-million to almost 66 times as much. Evidence suggests Transnet overpaid for the relocation of a train assembly plant. READ: Transnet exec in state capture inquiry hot seat Gonsalves told the commission, then Transnet CEO, Brian Molefe, was aware of what was going on. Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, wants answers. "It's a very strange situation. Transnet pays a lot of money to a company under circumstances which the minority shareholders of the company say we are part of the company, we are the minority shareholders  we know of no lawful course why you should pay this amount. The legal team should take steps to be in touch with the head of the Hawks. I want to know what's happening about this and why should it take so long for the matter to be concluded?" said Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, chair of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry.
