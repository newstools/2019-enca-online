ANKARA - A Turkish court handed multiple life sentences on Monday to a man convicted of a 2013 bombing that killed more than 50 people, which Turkey blames on Syria, local media reported.

Aggravated sentences, which replaced the death penalty in Turkey, carry harsher prison conditions. Nazik, a Turkish citizen, was caught last September by Turkey's intelligence services in the Syrian city of Latakia, a stronghold of support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
