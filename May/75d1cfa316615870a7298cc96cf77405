Courtesy of #DSTV403 CAPE TOWN - One of the oldest and most beloved independent cinemas in Cape Town turned 70 years old last week. The Labia has been operating since 1949. Loyal moviegoers and esteemed guests last week donned their best to celebrate its birthday.
 
Theatre owner Ludi Kraus said the Labia started life as a ballroom in the late 30s, early 40s. "In 1949, the ballroom was converted into a theatre and on 16 May 1949 it was opened by Princess Labia as a place for the arts."
The facade has pretty much stayed the same over the years. Guests were treated to a surprise screening of the film, Rocketman, only due to open at cinemas later this month.
