JOHANNESBURG - A Zulu ballet called 'Inala' featuring South Africa's Soweto Gospel Choir opens in London this week. "Inala" which means "abundance of goodwill" will include world class dancers is centered on the values of community and the journey of life, conjuring up imagery of African landscapes through song as a backdrop to ballet and contemporary dance. The Grammy award-winning choir says performing in a theater show has been an interesting experience. READ: Soweto Gospel Choir wins third Grammy award "It's not easy doing this whole production. We are actually out of our comfort zone as Soweto Gospel Choir, because we normally just rehearse and we don't count steps or whatever because it's stuff that is natural." "But something as technical as this production, it's quite hectic," said choir member Diniloxo Ndlakuse. The show, first for the ballet, debuted close to five years ago at the Edinburgh festival and featured another South African music group - Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Producers for Inala say they now have plans to take the show to Asia.
