#Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma is accusing the NPA of violating its own policies. He is applying for a permanent stay of prosecution. The former president is facing charges of racketeering, money-laundering, and corruption. WATCH: Zuma back in court with new legal team Zuma argues the prosecution body received instructions from outside forces. Muzi Sikhakhane, Zuma's lawyer says theÂ court must tell us how it views a national director of prosecutions taking instruction from an outsider. "An organ of state acted unconstitutionally, violated its own policies and lastly violated the constitution. I invite this court to read Mr Mpshe how the NPA head himself described their own conduct. The institutional itself has described their conduct as bad, indefensible and unlawful. It's not us only," he said.
