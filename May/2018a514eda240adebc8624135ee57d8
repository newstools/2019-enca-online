Abdelatif Noussir of Wydad clears the ball away from Phakamani Mahlambi of Sundowns during the 2018/19 CAF Champions League football match. JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns' quest for continental glory ended in the semi-final stage of the Caf Champions League. Sundowns trailed 2-1 at the start of the return-leg in Atteridgeville. Tensions between the two sides led to a scuffle in the first half. Sundowns were lacklustre in attack with Tebogo Langerman wasting one of the home side's best chances. The hosts could also land in trouble with Caf after one of their supporters threw a bottle onto the pitch. Wydad held on for a goalless draw to secure a 2-1 win on aggregate. The Moroccans will meet Esperance in the final.
