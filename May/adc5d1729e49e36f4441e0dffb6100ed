Maimane’s future has been in doubt after the party’s performance in last week’s elections. “We would like to state that Mr. Maimane remains our leader until the federal congress scheduled for 2021,” said DA Federal Chairperson Athol Trollip. “At that congress, the party will decide whether he continues as the leader or not. "Any talk of a change of leadership before the congress must be dispelled and we dispel it as the federal executive.” READ: Election a collective victory: Magashule The DA has lost five seats, dropping from 89 to 84 in the National Assembly.
