The ranking was released a day before World Press Freedom Day and although it is not a bad reflection for the country, South Africa -- ranking 28th in 2017 -- has dropped three places to number 31 on the list of 180 countries. Kate Skinner from the South African National Editors' Forum there are a few things that contributed towards the ranking of the country. 'Never forget' - Mogoeng reminds South Africans on Freedom Day "What are political leaders saying? Is there heat around journalists? Are journalists being intimidated, are they being intimidated on social media? Are they being intimidated on the field? "So if we had less heated rhetoric and intimidation in terms of social media, then I think we would jump a few points," said Skinner. World Press Freedom Day is meant to raise awareness of the importance of the freedom of press.
