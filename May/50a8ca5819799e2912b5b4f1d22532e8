File: Workers wanted to down tools over salaries among other matters on Wednesday when the election is planned to take place. Editor's note: Strong language in the video attached JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has responded to claims of a racial incident involving "different queues for blacks and whites" at a Western Cape polling station. In the viral video posted on Facebook, black and white voters can be seen in separate queues. In a statement released on Wednesday, the IEC confirmed the authenticity of the video but said the separate queues consisted of voters registered at the Wellington polling station and students registered elsewhere. READ: ANC embarrassed by MEC Mazibuko's 'racist remarks' "The Presiding officer, for practical purposes, placed them in a separate line as they need to complete a VEC4 form as stipulated under Section 24(a) of the Electoral Act before a ballot can be issued. "The other line of voters was registered at that particular voting station and therefore would be more practical to vote, as the students in the queue  would have retarded there opportunity to vote fluidly", read the statement. The IEC said the demographic categorisation shown in the video was coincidental.
