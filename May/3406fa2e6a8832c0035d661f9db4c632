The matter was brought forward by the Democratic Alliance and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) says Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is not fit to hold office.
The Gauteng High Court ruled the Public Protector's report on the Vrede dairy project as unconstitutional and invalid. WATCH: Court declares Mkhwebane's Vrede report unconstitutional Casac's Lawson Naidoo says he felt for a long time she (Mkhwebane) was not fit to hold office and that this judgement is clear evidence of her incapacity. "She ignored evidence freely available, she changed findings in her predecessor's report, she deliberately set out to craft the report in such a way those implicated will be exonerated. This was the classic case of state capture, it benefitted a few." WATCH: Public Protector fights on in Vrede report battle The Democratic Alliance and  Casac argued that Mkhwebane didn't interview senior politicians implicated in agricultural corruption. In her report, she found that the Free State Agriculture Department was guilty of maladministration as proper processes were not followed in the tender agreement with the Estina company. For reaction and analysis on today's ruling, eNCA speaks to Advocate Michael Osborne, a constitutional law expert from the University of Cape Town. #Dstv403
