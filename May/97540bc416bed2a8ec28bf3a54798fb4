Courtesy of #DSTV403 BOKSBURG - A baby born in three different parts at Tambo Memorial Hospital was an unavoidable death according to an investigation. The doctors and professional nurses acted within the scope of practice at all times and no negligence or mismanagement was involved, according to a report conducted by medical professionals and academics.

The report also shows that the young mother had been to the hospital a few weeks earlier.
It says 19-year-old Kagiso Kgatla could've been helped then and her family agrees.

Because if the hospital had attended her from the day she arrived there with the referral letter, I don't think these things would have happened like this." Kgatla says the young mother is still traumatised.
Professor Hendrick Lombaard, a Wits obstetrics professor, says although nothing could have been done to save the baby, perhaps sufficient attention could have helped give a better outcome. The Kgatla family admitted that the health minister has been helpful but they are still not satisfied and the pain lingers.
