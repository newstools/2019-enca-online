"He has been an outstanding asset, not only to the teams he played for, but also our supporters, to whom he endeared himself from early on with his attitude towards the Vodacom Bulls.

The Springboks flyhalf is in line to join a host of fellow countrymen including Jan and Bismarck du Plessis and Johan Goosen on the French south coast.
