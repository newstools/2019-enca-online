The former president says he doesn’t buy the idea, that white people in South Africa should be viewed as land thieves. “When the ANC says we are going to expropriate from whoever and give to our people, who in the eyes of the ANC among the South African population is not ‘our people’,” Mbeki told eNCA’s Aldrin Sampear on The First Citizen. “Another party can say that but the ANC can’t.” READ: Ramaphosa admits the ANC allowed state capture Mbeki's comment is in stark contrast with the ANC’s Nasrec resolution of land expropriation without compensation and the Amendment to Section 25 of the Constitution to explicitly allow for this. Last week, Mbeki campaigned for the ANC, telling South Africans to vote for the party. Mbeki says that the ANC has lost the plot on the land question. “The ANC says the Freedom Charter is our basic policy document and the Freedom Charter says ‘the land shall be shared among those who work it’,” he said. “Why are we departing from that?” Watch the full interview in the three segments in this article.
