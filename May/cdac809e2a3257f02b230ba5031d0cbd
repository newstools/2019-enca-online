Marie-Christine Jabr from the Isha Foundation says there is a misconception that meditation is difficult and that it takes a lot of work. "Most people think meditation is something difficult or it's some kind of, it takes a lot of work because most of the time when we sit with our eyes closed the mind becomes noisy and our thoughts are going on incessantly.

Jabr says music is one of the tools that can be used to help someone get started on their meditation journey. "There are many tools that one can use to attain a state of meditativeness from within, so to start people, to get someone going into meditation, we have a few things, some of them are available online, others are available in person and you can use music."
