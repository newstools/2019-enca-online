LAGOS - Zamfara State is reeling from a spate of attacks, with 203 crime-related deaths and 281 kidnappings in the first three months of 2019, according to Nigeria's top police officer, Mohammed Adamu. This is nearly half the 685 kidnappings countrywide in the first quarter of the year -- an average of seven per day. Another 1,071 people were killed in crime-related violence, Adamu recently told reporters.

But in recent years, the practice has spread to other areas, with northwest Nigeria -- the home region of President Muhammadu Buhari -- an increasingly concerning criminal front. The number of reported abductions across the country is rising, according to security experts. The causes are multiple, including difficult economic times and overstretched security forces facing threats on several fronts -- Islamist insurgents and land battles between herders and farmers.

"The gangs involved now appear more organised, operating in larger groups, with more elaborate logistics, striking more audaciously." And while they previously targeted "relatively well-to-do and high net-worth individuals", today "abductions are increasingly indiscriminate and everyone, rich or poor, is at risk," said Obasi. Targeted operations within the last week have led to the arrest of 93 suspected kidnappers across northern Nigeria, with dozens of automatic weapons confiscated, police said.
