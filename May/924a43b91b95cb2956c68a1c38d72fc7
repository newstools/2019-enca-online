Over 50 percent of young voters did not cast their vote with many citing that they feel like the government does not prioritize issues related to them. Brand SA ambassador, Ntsako Mhlanga, says it is difficult for young people to trust that things will change when there aren't many tangible results. READ: Youth unemployment at 55.2% "You had over 50% of young people who did not vote and when you ask them why they did not vote it's because they had no faith, they were really angry about how much didn't happen in the past 10 years." I mean you can't have six million young people who are unemployed at the moment, I mean we constantly tell young people go and get an education and then they do and then we tell them to get a job and they can't", said Mhlanga. Mhlanga says she hopes President Cyril Ramaphosa will prioritize employment for the youth. "The youth have a voice and we have been using our voices, can we just get jobs. We can't be educated and at home, we can't be educated on the streets asking for jobs as if we are beggers."
