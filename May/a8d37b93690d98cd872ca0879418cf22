Deputy President David Mabuza won't be sworn in as a member of Parliament on Wednesday. His decision is in light on an investigation by the ANC's Integrity Commission into his conduct. Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - ANC deputy president David Mabuza has requested the party to postpone his swearing-in as an MP. This is in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute. The ANC released a statement, saying Mabuza postponed his swearing-in as a member of the National Assembly out of respect for the ANC’s institutions and processes.
