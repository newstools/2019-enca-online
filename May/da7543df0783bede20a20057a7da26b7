Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - One person is in a critical condition after a security guard allegedly shot him in the face at the Bree Taxi Rank in Johannesburg. A terrified witness says he hid inside his stall on Sauer Street and caught the ensuing chaos on camera. “I had to run away from my shop because there was too much stones, the witness said. "I heard three gunshots which I could not tell – where they were coming. "Next thing I hear people say someone was shot in the face." The man and other witnesses told eNCA how a group of hawkers started throwing stones at security guards. The vendors accuse them of illegally confiscating their goods.

The JMPD continued its investigations on Sunday but it denies any links with people calling themselves security guards. “No, those are people who allege to be security guards," said JMPD Spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. "They do not work for the JMPD and if anyone sees a JMPD officer working with any of these so-called security guards, must report this to us immediately”. No arrests have yet been made. eNCA reporter Masego Rahlaga has more details in the video above.
