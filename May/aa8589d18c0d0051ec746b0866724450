Sundowns have been clinical when playing at home this campaign. They scored a 2-1 win when Wydad visited the Lucas Moripe stadium during the group stages. PRETORIA - Mamelodi Sundowns are one match away from securing a Caf Champions League Final spot. They face the Moroccan side at home at Lucas Moripe Stadium in the return leg this afternoon. However, it won’t be a walk in the park for the Brazilians as they have to overturn a 2-1 semi-final first leg loss against Wydad Casablanca on their home soil. READ: Pitso demands goals at Wydad Casablanca wasted goalscoring chances in the first leg but did manage two goals. But, Sundowns' away goal could be massive in the final result. "The away goal rule only works in case of a draw and it has it says something but when there's no draw it doesn't say anything it remains the way it is so we have to score if we want to change the result we have to score,” Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said.
