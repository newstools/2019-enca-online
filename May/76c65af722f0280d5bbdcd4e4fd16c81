Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Islamic call to prayer can be heard five times a day in cities and towns the world over. In Cape Town, a resident has complained that the call is “too noisy”. Members of the Muslim community are incensed that a formal investigation will now be pursued. “People, communities and social media have been asking why the city has jumped on this complaint or this affidavit that this one resident has lodged, and it's simple, in terms of the Western Cape noise regulations, in terms of the Environment Conservation Act, the city is legally compelled to investigate and engage,” said Mayco member for community services and health, Zahid Badroodien. WATCH: What is Ramadaan? The investigation that will take place after the holy month of Ramadaan, will include a sound test to measure if the athaan is within by-laws limits. But the city says education and tolerance are key. Those who've been attending mosque here for over a decade, say the complaint is both silly and dangerous. “I think it's silly you know because some people that are not Muslim they appreciate the sound that comes from the calls to prayer. JUMP If they do get it right at one mosque, they are going to start it everywhere, this is the danger of it,” said Abdurahman Jattem. The mosque is considering a petition to garner support and fight the complaint.
