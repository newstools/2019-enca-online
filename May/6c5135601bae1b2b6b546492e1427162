The pair declined their seats after the ANC Caucus's meeting. Mbete was heavily criticised by opposition parties for not taking former President Jacob Zuma to task. While Gigaba was found to have violated the executive ethics code and lied under oath. Mbete will be replaced by Thandi Modise the former National Council of Provinces Speaker. Members of Parliament are expected to be sworn-in on Wednesday. #Dstv403
