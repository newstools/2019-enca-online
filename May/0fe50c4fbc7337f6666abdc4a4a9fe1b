However, after a ruling by the North Gauteng High Court, this will be a thing of the past. "The High court ruled in our favour and we are grateful as domestic workers and this is a victory", said Pinky Mashiane, co-founder and president of the United Domestic Workers of SA. READ: 15,000 domestic worker jobs lost in 2019 first quarter Domestic workers performing household work will now be eligible to claim from the Compensation Fund. "A domestic worker must be registered the same way it is with the UIF," Mashiane said. "The government must sit down with the employer and tell them how they're going to implement this. "Many domestic workers have died in the line of duty. It's as if domestic workers are not workers and we are valuable....we contribute a lot to the economy of this country, added Mashiane. "Domestic workers can put this country to a standstill if they were all unionist and fight in one voice."
