Wales' head coach Warren Gatland looks on prior to the Six Nations rugby union tournament match between France and Wales at the stade de France, in Saint Denis, on the outskirts of Paris. LONDON - Warren Gatland has reportedly agreed to become head coach of the British and Irish Lions for the tour to South Africa in 2021. The Lions have moved swiftly to secure the Wales coach for a record third successive term, in the process ending the prospect of the Kiwi replacing Eddie Jones as England boss after the World Cup.

Gatland oversaw a Six Nations Grand Slam for Wales this season but will stand down from that role after this year's World Cup in Japan. The former Ireland coach guided the Lions to a series win in Australia in 2013 and a drawn campaign against world champions New Zealand two years ago. He would complete the set of all Lion's tour destinations with South Africa.
