Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The Campaign Against Canned Hunting has again called for a ban on wild animal interactions after another animal attack was widely reported on. A 4-year-old girl has been left in a critical condition after being attacked by a lioness at Weltevrede Lion Farm in Heilbron at the weekend. There have been several other attacks in South Africa due to petting and other interactions, with some of them ending tragically. The campaign stated the animals are habituated to human contact and as such don't fear people, increasing the risk of attacks. Captive animals are also often used for canned hunting.
