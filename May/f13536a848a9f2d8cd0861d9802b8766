She says the president needs to rise to the occasion and appoint leaders with integrity. Madonsela has indicated that Ramaphosa's new dawn has been rebooted through a relatively peaceful election but what's next for South Africa? She says Ramaphosa will be closely watched as to the type of person he appoints to his Cabinet. "How should he choose? Must be competent, trustworthy and least selfish," said Madonsela who was delivering the Archbishop Thabo Makgoba lecture at the University of the Western Cape.
