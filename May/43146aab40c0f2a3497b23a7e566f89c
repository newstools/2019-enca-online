JOHANNESBURG - Former finance Minister Tito Mboweni received mixed reviews on social media on Tuesday after posting a picture of what he was having for lunch. In a series of tweets, Mboweni revealed his culinary skills by taking his followers through a tutorial of how he prepares beef stew. READ: Mboweni accepts Saftu memorandum "Beef stew alert!! The bottle on the left contains “Shito” from Ghana. We are starting early today! Come with me...", read the caption. After a few hours and a few more tweets explaining the process, the minister posted the final product but most South Africans were not too impressed with what was presented, while others said he made a good effort.
