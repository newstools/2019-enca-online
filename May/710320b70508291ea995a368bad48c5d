A drought in the country has reduced water levels in the dam that feeds the Kariba Power Station. The outages are likely to hit the lucrative mining sector the most. Zimbabweans were warned last week that they may soon be facing power cuts exacerbating difficulties in a country already grappling with a lack of US dollars, soaring prices and shortages of fuel, food and medicines.

The announcement came from state-owned utility ZETDC which said it may ration electricity supplies as low water levels reduce output from its biggest hydro plant while ageing coal-fired power stations are shuttered or running at reduced capacity demand of 2,100 megawatts. In the capital Harare, some residents said they have already been experiencing power cuts, known locally as load-shedding, since the beginning of this week.
