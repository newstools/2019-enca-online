Manchester City's German midfielder Leroy Sane controls the ball during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second leg football match between Manchester City and Schalke 04 at the Etihad Stadium. BERLIN - Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness confirmed on Thursday that the newly-crowned Bundesliga champions are considering a summer move for Manchester City winger Leroy Sane. Kicker magazine reported earlier this week that Sane, 23, was "a candidate" for Bayern's major transfer offensive this close season, and Hoeness confirmed the club's interest to Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.

The German winger was linked to Bayern before joining City from Schalke for €50-million in 2016. According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report, City coach Pep Guardiola is keen to keep Sane, but the club are looking to sell him. The Germany international is reportedly unhappy with a lack of game time, having started in just three of City's last 10 league games. If Bayern were to sign him, he would be the first attacking player to arrive in what Hoeness has called "the biggest investment programme in our club's history".
