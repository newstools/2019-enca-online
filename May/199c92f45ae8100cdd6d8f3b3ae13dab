As the continent celebrates Africa Day - how proud are we really of being African? Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Two fashion designers from different parts of Africa have collaborated to express their love and pride for the continent through their work. Aurelie Tshibombo who was born in the DRC and raised in South Africa says every day should be Africa Day.
“When someone wears a dress with African print or a doek, you will hear other people ask what the occasion is or whether there is a funeral. Why? Why should there be an occasion? We should be able to dress in our cookies all the time. Any day we want to and anywhere we want to”, said Tshibombo.

That’s why I did this collaboration with Aurelie. To show that we can do things together”, said Botha.
Both designers agree that more to be done to celebrate what being African means, no matter which part of the continent one's from.
