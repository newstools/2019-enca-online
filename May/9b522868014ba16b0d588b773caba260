Makhura says this will help deal with the rising population in the province. The Gauteng premier said this must be one of the priorities of the National Council of Provinces. "I want to say on behalf of the delegation from Gauteng province, one of the first things we would like NCOP to look at is that Gauteng in terms of population, the size of our legislature is not optimal,” Makhura told the first sitting of the NCOP. “We have the largest population in the country. “We want to say it should be the among the first priority of the sixth NCOP."
