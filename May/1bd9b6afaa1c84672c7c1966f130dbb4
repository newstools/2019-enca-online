Malusi Gigaba, Baleka Mbete AND Nomvula Mokonyane have declined seats in Parliament. And David Mabuza has postponed his swearing in. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Political analyst, Makhosini Mgitywa, says former Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, should not be appointed to Cabinet. Mgitywa said this is because of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings against him. Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct in relation to a pension payout to former Deputy SARS commissioner, Ivan Pillay. “It would be a very dangerous mistake if he were to take a conscious decision of removing people who are aligned with the former president,” Mgitywa said. “I think what he would use as his principle would be if you are implicated in acts of corruption and state capture and all those I cannot consider for a Cabinet position. “That would implicate people in his own faction.” Mgitywa says Mkhwebane's findings have made Gordhan unemployable.
