Vote counting in one of the most hotly contested elections in SA history is under way. PRETORIA - Elections officials counted ballot papers in the early hours of Thursday, a day after a vote seen as the toughest test yet for the ANC. The elections for a new parliament and nine provincial legislatures are the first barometer of national sentiment since President Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Jacob Zuma as head of state in February 2018. Opinion polls suggest the ANC will again win a majority of the parliament's 400 seats, but analysts say its margin of victory may fall amid frustration with slow progress addressing racial disparities in income and wealth.
