Mchunu is a hardcore communist, unionist and struggle stalwart whose contribution isn't widely recognised and he has had to lead one of the most volatile provinces in the country. ANC provincial Sihle Zikalala, who set to become the youngest premier of KwaZulu-Natal, will succeed Mchunu. The outgoing incumbent has urged Zikalala to prioritise stability in the province.

Zikalala is getting ready to take over his hot seat and will be inheriting a province plagued by violent crime. With declining electoral support, the ANC-led administration will have to work hard to fast-track service delivery to citizens who are becoming impatient.
