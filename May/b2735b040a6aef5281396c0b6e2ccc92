File: Eskom is battling with liquidity problems. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's Public Enterprises ministry on Thursday said that a China Development Bank (CDB) loan to struggling state power company Eskom was not in jeopardy. Eskom had expected to draw down R7-billion ($481 million) from a $2.5 billion CDB loan facility by late March, but South Africa's finance ministry said in a report to parliament last month that the drawdown had been delayed. The delay meant South Africa had to bring forward a planned bailout for Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the electricity in Africa's most industrialised economy but has been grappling with a severe financial crisis. The South African government and Eskom are working to ensure the transfer of funds from CDB to Eskom, the public enterprises ministry said in a statement.

The Chinese loan to Eskom was agreed in July last year, during a visit to South Africa by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
