PIETERMARITZBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma's legal team wanted to introduce new evidence it claims is crucial. Zuma's team introduced a letter it claims is from the NPA. The document purportedly demands an investigation into the role of former Justice Minister Penuell Maduna into the Zuma-Thales investigation. READ: State says it has strong evidence against Zuma Zuma and his co-accused, French arms company Thales, want to have corruption charges against them permanently stayed. The State pushed for Zuma to face trial for a case dating back to the 1990s, saying if he did not it would appear he received special treatment. "There is a high risk that if Mr Zuma escapes prosecution, that he will be seen to have received special treatment because he is an important and a powerful man," said state lawyer Wim Trengrove.

The prosecution dismissed as "unfounded" Zuma's allegations that he was victim of a "witch hunt". "There is not a shred of evidence the decision to prosecute Mr Zuma was in any way politically motivated," said Trengrove. READ: Zuma claims charges against him a 'political ploy' "There is a very compelling case against him". Thales has said it cannot get a fair trial given the "very long delay of this procedure -- through no fault of Thales at all". Proceedings resume on Friday. - Additional reporting Reuters
