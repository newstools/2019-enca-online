The statistician general Risenga Maluleke will present the sample study at midday. Mamabolo said politicians should stay away from taking a few problems and generalising them. "If double voting has happened it must have been on such a grand scale as to influence over 17 million voters. "Assuming that it has happened, the scale can't be so significant that it influences the overall outcome of the election," he said. Putting things in perspective, Mamabolo explained, to have a meaningful impact, 45,000 people would have to vote more than once.

According to Mambolo, the group of people who attempted to vote more than once were caught as a group, at one voting station by the presiding officer at work there.
