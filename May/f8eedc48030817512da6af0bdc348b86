He was speaking at Cosatu's May Day Rally in Clermont outside Durban. “We also say there also those who continue to violate workers’ rights who continue to pay poverty wages. Who endanger the lives and wellbeing of their employees. We want them to stop exploiting the rights of our workers,” he said.
