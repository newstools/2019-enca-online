Investigators believe Jessica Kuhn and Johanco Fleishman were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were shot dead and their vehicle set alight after they ran out of fuel on the N12 in Benoni. The crime has shone a light on an area community policing forums say is notoriously dangerous. A family investigator probing the double murder believes illegal mining in the area could be behind the violence. "They thought that they are somebody who wants to buy this illegal mining products," said Private Investigator Vince Harris. READ: NGO calls for zama-zamas to be legalised Speculation has pointed to illegal mining as the problem making the bridge dangerous. "I’ve been working underground for a week,” said an anonymous illegal miner. “After another week I’ll go back to my place." Covered in gold dust, the mining operation is a fully functional gold production, fertile ground for illegal guns and explosives, and even allegations of police involvement. Gunshots ringing out randomly are a reminder that it is business as usual for those fighting for gold. eNCA reporter Nqobile Madlala has more details in the video above.
