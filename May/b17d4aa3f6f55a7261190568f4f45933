Gorillas from the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden trying to escape the rain COLUMBIA, America - A hilarious video of a gorilla troop, trying desperately to get out of the rain, has been viewed over eight million times on Facebook. The footage was posted by Riverbanks Zoo and Garden zookeeper Brooke Hunsinger on 3 May. "Gorillas are magnificent, majestic creatures full of grace and beauty ... except when it rains," she wrote. In the footage, the gorillas - some of them holding babies - are seen huddling under a narrow roof while visitors to the zoo watch them. One of the primates, holding a baby, is seen peeking around a corner to see if there is a better spot to hide. A braver gorilla then dashes for cover and is followed one-by-one by the remaining gorillas - all grimacing as they shimmy along the wall to safety.
