During this time healthy adult Muslims fast as an act of worship, by abstaining from drinking, eating and immoral acts from dawn until dusk. Muslims will get up before sunrise to eat a meal called suhoor, and they break their fast after the sun sets with a meal called the iftar. Zakariyya Harnekar from the Muslim Judicial Council of South Africa says the purpose behind Ramadaan is for greater spiritual benefit.

In South Africa, Ramadaan will begin on Monday night.
