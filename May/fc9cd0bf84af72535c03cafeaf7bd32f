Speculation continues to mount over who will make it to President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - ANC Deputy President David Mabuza is not eligible for a position as the country's Deputy President, for now. This according to the president's spokesperson, Khusela Diko. READ: Calls mount for SA to appoint female deputy president Diko says while Mabuza is the party's deputy president, he has not yet been sworn-in as a Member of Parliament. "I understand that David Mabuza has requested a postponement of his swearing in. If he is eventually sworn in then he will be eligible..." she said. Mabuza requested the party to postpone his swearing-in as an MP in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute.

The president is expected to announce his Cabinet later this week.
