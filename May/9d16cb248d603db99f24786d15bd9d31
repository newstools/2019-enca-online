National vote counting is approaching the halfway mark. The IEC has just announced that more than forty-four percent of the votes have been counted. Let's get you reaction to that Aldrin Sampear is here at the Results Operations Centre in Pretoria Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairperson, Pansy Tlakula, says the problem with double voting goes beyond the removal of the indelible ink, but with the fact that the law allows voters to vote at a station they are not registered in. "The problem is with the provision of the law, which is Section 24(A) of the Electoral Act that allows voters to vote at a station, other than where they are registered. I think that is where the problem is," said Tlakula. Tlakula says although the intentions of Section 24(A) are good they do make it difficult for the IEC when it comes to planning.

Tlakula has called for the IEC and political parties to re-look the Section once the elections are over. "The blame is being put on the IEC, the IEC is actually implementing a provision in the law that has been adopted by Parliament," she says.
