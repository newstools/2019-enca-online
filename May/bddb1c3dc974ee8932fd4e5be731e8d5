Nkosazana-Dlamini-Zuma is amongst the first few high ranking ANC officials to cast special votes. Courtesy #DStv403 KWADUKUZA – Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said that she is ready to serve in any capacity in government, including being deputy president should the ANC retain power. Dlamini-Zuma -- who lost out to President Cyril Ramaphosa in the ANC leadership race at their 54th national conference in 2017 -- has not ruled out being the country’s second in command. “Who becomes deputy is the president’s prerogative,” said Dlamini-Zuma. “I’ve always said that if I am asked to sweep the floor, I will sweep it very clean. So whatever I am asked to. I will do.” READ: Election 2019 underway Dlamini-Zuma cast her special vote in KwaDukuza in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. She is amongst the first few high- ranking ANC officials to cast special votes. The former chairperson of the African Union Commission has encouraged despondent young people to vote in order to shape their future. “It is very important to shape the future,” said Dlamini-Zuma. “Young people are for today but also they are for the future. So they better shape the future that they want to inherit today. “One of the ways of doing that is actually taking responsibility to vote and it is a sign of being a good citizen to take the responsibility to vote.”
