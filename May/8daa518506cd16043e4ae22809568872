Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Almost 17 months to the day after its scheduled release date, Steinhoff International is expected to finally publish its 2017 annual results on Tuesday. These are the financials that led to the resignation of then-CEO Markus Jooste, causing the company's share price to nosedive. Steinhoff has delayed releasing the results several times. More than R185-billion has been lost due to the Steinhoff debacle that rocked markets in December 2017. “Steinhoff’s reaction was to simply say how do we avoid being drawn into massive litigation, so let us say as little as possible. And that really has been the theme that they have undertaken,” said political and financial analyst Khaya Sithole.

This is apparently one of the reasons why the results have been delayed. It's believed the report is fingering Jooste and a small group of former executives for the crash.
