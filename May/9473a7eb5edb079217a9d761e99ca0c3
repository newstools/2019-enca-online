Tshwane Community Safety MMC Karen Meyer said the affected students will be receiving counselling.

Meyer said the newly adopted, revised and strategic framework for crime prevention, safety and security of the TMPD will ensure high police visibility. "We are going back to visible policing, we've got so many departments within the metro police, cable theft unit, drug unit but its time we have a collective working situation within our region."
