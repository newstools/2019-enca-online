Men carry coffins containing newly-discovered remains of 84,437 victims of the 1994 genocide during a funeral ceremony at the Nyanza Genocide Memorial. KIGALI - The remains of nearly 85,000 people murdered in Rwanda's genocide were laid to rest in a sombre ceremony in Kigali, a quarter of a century after the slaughter. Mourners sobbed as 81 white coffins containing the remains of 84,437 victims of the 1994 mass killings were buried at the Nyanza Genocide Memorial in the capital. They were among more than 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, massacred over 100 days by Hutu extremists and militia forces determined to eradicate the Tutsi minority in Rwanda. Rwanda begins 100 days of mourning every April 7 -- the day the genocide began. But this year has witnessed particular commemorations to mark the 25th anniversary. READ: Rwanda 'a family again', 25 years after genocide: Kagame "Commemorating the genocide against the Tutsi is every Rwandanâ€™s responsibility -- and so is giving them a decent burial," said Justice Minister Johnston Busingye at the mass burial. Some mourners broke down wailing as survivors spoke of the pain of losing their loved ones so brutally. A number were escorted from the funeral by ushers. The remains of those interred on Saturday were only found early last year, when 143 pits containing thousands of bone and clothing fragments were discovered beneath homes on the outskirts of Kigali. Those exhumed for burial on Saturday came from just 43 such pits -- leaving 100 more to go. A painstaking effort was undertaken so that family members could identify their loved ones by their teeth, clothing and other markings. They join 11,000 other victims already laid to rest at the Nyanza Genocide Memorial.
