In this year’s elections, Blind SA together with the IEC have introduced the universal ballot template. Courtesy #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Blind SA together with the Independent Electoral Commission has introduced a universal ballot template to help blind or partially sighted voters to cast their votes in this year’s polls. In the past, blind or partially sighted voters have experienced difficulties casting their votes. The template is one of the simpler ways in which blind people can cast their ballots.

It should have a large print on it so that a person with low can see which party they can vote for. “It is can be used by people with low vision and totally blind people at the same.” The template is also for dyslexic people or people with shaky hands.
