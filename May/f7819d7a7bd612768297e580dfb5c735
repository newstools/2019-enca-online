JOHANNESBURG - The University of Cape Town is offering a short course on Khoekhoegowab, an indigenous Khoi language. The endangered Khoi language has been given a chance to take its rightful place after members of the broader Khoi and San communities have highlighted the plight of their diminishing culture. Dr June Bam-Hutchinson from the UCT Centre for African Studies says there has been a flood of interest in the course from people across the country.

Heritage activist Bradley Van Sitters says although the short course is a step in the right direction, however, more needs to be done. The short course will officially be launched in June.
