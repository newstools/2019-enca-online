JOHANNESBURG - DA leader Mmusi Maimane urged voters to give "change a chance" in next week's general election after 25 years of ANC rule. "Let us be brave and give change a chance," Mmusi Maimane told more than 10,000 Democratic Alliance supporters at Dobsonville stadium in Soweto.

"Today the choice is between fear and bravery. If South Africans were not brave, I Â bet you apartheid would still be in place. "We are brave and we are going to show courage and hope for change in this election". He slammed the ANC for degenerating from "leaders in the struggle for freedom" to those who now "stand directly in the way of freedom". "They were once our liberators but today we need to be liberated from them," Maimane told the cheering crowd in his home township. A sea of blue-clad supporters packed the stadium for a liberal group that has struggled to shed its image as a party for middle-class whites. The DA has hammered away on the ANC's failure to deliver Mandela's dream of a prosperous and equal South Africa. The Democratic Alliance is wrapping up its election campaign in Gauteng today. Party faithful will gather at Soweto's Dobsonville Stadium.
