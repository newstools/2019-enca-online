eNCA caught up with a few celebrities at their respective polling stations. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Some prominent names in the entertainment business were out and about on Wednesday to make their mark. Stepping onto a different stage, renowned South African comedianÂ Marc Lottering put the spotlight on his all-important vote.
"You know, we have the opportunity to vote. People have given their lives so that we can come here today," said Lottering. Comedian, actor and author Nik Rabinowitz braved the queues to have his say.
"It always feels good," he said. "I cast my vote here in 1994, I was 18 years old. So it brings back memories." Cape Town musician, actor and producer Alistair Izobell was also spotted in the queues.
"[It's] quite a different experience from voting before," said Izobell. "Now we just wait for the results and hope that it's a good result."
