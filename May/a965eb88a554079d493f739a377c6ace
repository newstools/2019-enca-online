Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn facing the audience wearing the gold crown while sitting on the throne during his coronation at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. BANGKOK - To the boom of cannons, pipes and chants, King Maha Vajiralongkorn was crowned in a ceremony governed by centuries-old rituals, vowing a righteous reign and calling for "national security" and "happiness" in a remarkable display of royal power. The public was granted a rare window into the cloistered halls of Thai royalty as the three-day coronation began. King Vajiralongkorn is the tenth monarch of the Chakri dynasty, which hasÂ reigned over the kingdom since 1782. He ascended the throne over two years ago following the death of his beloved father. Saturday's sombre ceremony opened with the white-gowned king receiving sacred water and dabbing it gently across his face at a shrine inside the Grand Palace complex. A cannon salute marked the moment as pipes played and Buddhist monks chanted. Several grey-haired Hindu Brahmins were also in attendance at a ceremony that symbolises Rama X's transformation from human to divine figure. He later took his seat under the umbrella of state and was handed the Great Crown of Victory, a 7.3-kilogram tiered gold headpiece topped by a diamond from India. Draped in bejewelled royal regalia summoning images of another era, in contrast with consumer-mad Bangkok outside palace walls, Vajiralongkorn vowed to reign "with righteousness" for the benefit of Thais.
