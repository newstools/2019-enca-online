File: Pravin Gordhan (L) shakes hands with President Cyril Ramaphosa after being sworn in as the new South African minister of Public Enterprises at parliament in Cape Town on February 27, 2018. JOHANNESBURG - The EFF wants Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to do the honourable thing and fall on his sword. The party says that, as a “constitutional delinquent”, Gordhan is no different from Malusi Gigaba, Nomvula Mokonyane, and Bathabile Dlamini. “This is pure disregard for the Constitution, abuse of power and maladministration,” the party said in a statement. “He now falls squarely in the line of many constitutional delinquents against whom chapter 9 institutions and our courts have found.” READ: Gordhan to review Mkhwebane's report The EFF has never been a fan of Gordhan, and the public protector's finding gives the party ammunition it's been looking for. The EFF is now calling on President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa not to re-appoint Gordhan to Cabinet. The party says even if Gordhan plans to take the public protector's report to court on review, he must do what David Mabuza did, and step aside.
