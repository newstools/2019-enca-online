The PIC Inquiry has adjourned until the 18th of June. SA Home Loans CEO Kevin Penwarden was on the stand today. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Kholofelo Maponya, a beneficiary of a Public Investment Corporation loan is still demanding R 95-billion in so-called 'transaction origination fees'. Maponya owns 25-percent of SA Home Loans after the PIC granted the investment however questions are being raised at the PIC inquiry about why he should get any fee at all. SA Home Loans CEO Kevin Penwarden says he was told that the 'fee' was not part of the contract he signed with the PIC and the mortgage provider. “I was pressed under immense pressure by Mr Maponya, he indicated to me that the mistake was going to be fixed by the PIC and the SAHL would have to honour the invoice." WATCH: SA Home Loans CEO testifies at PIC inquiry "He even asked if SAHL could provide MMI with the SAHL letter confirming that we would process the invoice which would be paid in due course”, said Penwarden. It appears as if former PIC CEO Dan Matjila promised Maponya the origination fee, but soon after had to backtrack. “I had raised the issue of fees with Dr Dan to let him know that Mr Maponya was threatening legal action on the R45m arranging fees. Dr Dan was vigorous in his response and said that Mr Maponya/MMI had not delivered any services and there was no contract and so I should go back to Maponya and tell him to “bring it on”. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that the Hawks are investigating the corporation's Matjila and four others in connection with evidence that has emerged at the commission. The Commission will resume on 18 June.
