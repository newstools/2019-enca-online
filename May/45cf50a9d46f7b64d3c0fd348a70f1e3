ALGIERS - Thousands of Algerians pushed through police tear gas in the capital on Friday to rally at the focal point of mass protests against the country's ruling elite. Riot police for hours prevented demonstrators from marching on the iconic central post office, with officials citing security concerns, but they ultimately gave way under pressure from the crowds. "Shame on you police officers," protesters shouted as tensions rose, with a few scuffles but no serious injuries reported. Around a dozen people were helped by volunteers, the majority feeling faint due to the heat and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. Demonstrators clutching the Algerian flag and brandishing home-made signs far outnumbered riot police, wearing blue helmets and body armour.

Initially demonstrating against ailing president Abdelaziz Bouteflika seeking a fifth term, since his departure last month protesters have turned their attention to those still in power with ties to the former leader. "Gaid Salah leave!" protesters shouted against the army chief, while others cried: "No military state." A former Bouteflika loyalist and key powerbroker, Ahmed Gaid Salah has thrown his support behind presidential elections set for July 4. But protesters -- some clutching "no to the elections" placards -- fear the polls could be used to keep longtime Bouteflika allies in power.
