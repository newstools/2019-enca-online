JOHANNESBURG - The big political parties that fill up stadiums aren't the only ones contesting Wednesday's poll. A record number of 48 political parties are in the running and all of them are determined to claim the people’s vote. The Azanian People's Organisation says it has received a good reception during its campaign trail. The party says it is engaged with various communities and is confident of a better showing at the polls. "Fortunately this time around we were able to start timeously, and we are favoured by the way the ruling government is doing things,” said Azapo president Strike Thokoana. “When people became despondent and fed up with what was happening, they would have then remembered what Azapo has been saying to them over the years. “We brought in the issue of land, we brought in what Steve Biko gave to the people, his life but also the ideology of black consciousness.” READ: IEC ready for special votes African People's Convention president Themba Godi believes his party will also perform better in the election.
