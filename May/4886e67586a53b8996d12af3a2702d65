Day 2 of the Duduzane Zuma trial has come with its fair share of surprises. JOHANNESBURG - The moment at which Duduzane Zuma will learn his fate in his culpable homicide trial is drawing closer. The businessman crashed his Porsche into a taxi on a rainy evening in February 2014, killing 30-year-old Phumzile Dube. He's pleaded not guilty.

Zuma remains confident it was. The defence has called an expert witness Konrad Lotter who testified that the Porsche 911, with its lightweight and wide tyres, is prone to aquaplaning even at low speeds of 60km/h.

Asked why it's taken him five years to come forward and give his version of what he saw that night, he says it's because in late 2017 he heard AfriForum's Gerrie Nel was going to prosecute the case. He claims he wants Zuma to have a fair trial as he knows Nel would be "going for blood". The case resumes on 20 June for closing arguments.
