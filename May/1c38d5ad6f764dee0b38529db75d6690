The final season of Game of Thrones airs Sundays at 9PM on HBO. JOHANNESBURG - A petition launched on Change.org urging HBO to remake the final season of Game of Thrones has managed to gather more than 340,000 signatures so far. The popular series has received massive backlash on social media from fans who say the dip in the quality of the show is due to the fact that writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss no longer had the books by George R.R. Martin as a blueprint.

"David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have proven themselves to be woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material (i.e. the books) to fall back on. This series deserves a final season that makes sense. Subvert my expectations and make it happen, HBO!", read the description. The shows penultimate episode, "The Bells" is now recorded as the lowest-rated episode in the show’s history.
