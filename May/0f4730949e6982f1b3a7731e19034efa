Former president Jacob Zuma was back at the KwaZulu-Natal High Cout in Pietermaritzburg this morning. PIETERMARITZBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma says he is unhappy with the lack of cooperation from the National Prosecuting Authority. Zuma says the prosecution has been selective with the information presented. "The selectiveness of the information that is put out there is a problem," Zuma said outside the KwaZulu Natala High Court in Pietermaritzburg. The former president says he is confident in his defence team and the way they are handling the case. WATCH: Zuma confident in legal team Speaking in IsiZulu, while addressing hordes of supporters outside the court, Zuma said his case has political interference. Meanwhile, Zuma's legal team wants to submit new evidence. Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane says it should be allowed, as it shows political interference in Zuma's corruption case.
