Leaders including Mosebenzi Zwane, ANC Deputy President David Mabuza, Bathabile Dlamini and Gwede Mantashe have appeared before the commission. The members of the country's ruling party have been accused of bringing the ANC into disrepute. READ: Mabuza not eligible for Deputy President role, for now So far Mabuza is the only ANC leader on a list of 20 who voluntarily chose not to be sworn in as an MP last week. Meanwhile Zwane, who has already been sworn in as an MP, said he would consider resigning based on the reasons given in the report. "It will depend on the reasons that they put on the table. I get deployed by the organisation and that’s me”, said Zwane. The commission, chaired by George Mashamba, needs to submit the report by Tuesday afternoon.
