Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn says some African leaders are overstaying their welcome in office. Desalegn says Africa still has a long way to go in benefitting from democracy. "We have worrisome issues we have leaders who stay in power for several years and they continue changing the constitution and their age," Hailemariam said.

Desalegn also wants to see more female leaders. Last year, in his home country, Sahle Work Zewde was appointed as the first woman president. Desalegn wants this Africa Day to be a reflection on what's gone wrong and what's been achieved on the continent. Despite all the challenges, the former leader says there's no need to despair if some African leaders would only change their current trajectories.
