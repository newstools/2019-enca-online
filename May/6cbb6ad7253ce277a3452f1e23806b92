WASHINGTON - Five people died and one person was missing Monday after two floatplanes collided mid-air in Alaska while carrying passengers from a cruise ship's sightseeing expedition, officials said. The two aircraft - a Beaver floatplane and an Otter floatplane - had been carrying 16 passengers from the Royal Princess cruise ship when they crashed near Ketchikan around 1:00 pm (2100 GMT), Princess Cruises said in a statement circulated by US media. The dead included four passengers and a pilot, according to Princess Cruises. Ten people were rescued and were receiving medical care.

"With the loss of life in this case, we know that the impact to Alaska is immense and our thoughts are with the community here." The National Transportation Safety Board said it was launching a "Go Team" to investigate the cause of the accident.
