eNCA's Stefan Goosen filed this report. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Steeped in culture, heritage, and history, the Bo-Kaap is one of Cape Town’s oldest areas. But now, residents say tour guides in the city are threatening this by misinforming tourists of its past. READ: Bo-Kaap granted heritage protection They want trained guides and knowledgeable residents to be included on tours to relay its true history. Residents hear tour guides say homes are painted in an array of colours to identify who lives where. READ: Small legal victory for Bo-Kaap residents And they go on to say that guides attribute this to the slaves of days gone, being either drunk or illiterate. According to some, the area’s history of slavery itself is being told incorrectly. eNCA's Stefan Goosen has more details in the video above.
