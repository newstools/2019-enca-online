JOHANNESBURG - Afrikaans has once again made headlines internationally, this time being featured in the latest episode of Netflix series Lucifer. In the first episode of season 4, actress Lesley-Ann Brandt -- who plays demon Maze -- speaks Afrikaans after her psychotherapist tells her that maybe speaking her language would help her. "Kan jy vir my verstaan wat ek praat? Want ek wil saam met jou praat," Maze responded in a distorted voice.

Brandt, who was actually born in South Africa, took to Twitter on Thursday to answer questions related to the show and confirmed that she was actually speaking Afrikaans during the episode. "So I'm actually speaking Afrikaans, which is a South African language, one of our eleven official languages, just with a slightly distorted voice, which I put on," she said.
