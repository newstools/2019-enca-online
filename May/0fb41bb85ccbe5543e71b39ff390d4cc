Dewani's uncle Ashok Hindocha says he is happy with the way things proceedings for the parole hearing have been handled. READ: Dewani killer up for parole "It feels like it was yesterday when we landed in Cape Town, it felt like back then, like nothing has changed. Four years ago, it was a nightmare in court," said Hindocha. We did not, I did not expect that in courts but what I experienced today is the way the courts should've been four years ago, heard this case properly, through all the channels respectfully, soberly, then maybe the outcome could have been different." An official announcement of the proceedings is yet to be made although, Tongo is only legally eligible for parole from September.
