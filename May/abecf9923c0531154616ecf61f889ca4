She says she has been continuously targeted by the IAAF. The Olympic 800-metres champion said in a statement: “For a decade the IAAF has tried to slow me down, but this has actually made me stronger. The decision of the CAS will not hold me back. I will once again rise above and continue to inspire young women and athletes in South Africa and around the world.” WATCH: Semenya loses battle over new testosterone rule Semenya will now have to artificially reduce her testosterone when competing.
