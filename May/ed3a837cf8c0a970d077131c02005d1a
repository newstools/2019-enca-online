Land Reform Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane says her department doesn't have the money for land restitution in District Six. CAPE TOWN - Land Reform Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane says her department doesn't have the money for land restitution in District Six. She appeared before the Western Cape High Court this morning to give details of her department's plan for claims in the Cape Town area. Nkoana-Mashabane spent just under six hours trying to explain why restitution in former District Six has been so slow. READ: District Six land claimants want answers The minister said, "if the cost of a unit where an indigent family is staying or a family that has to be restituted is R1,5-million in District Six, for us it's not how we should run away from that reality but how we should work together." She says public and private sector stakeholders must help make up the over R2-billion shortfall the department needs to redevelop the area. Her appearance comes after the failure to comply with a prior court order, which called for a comprehensive plan to redevelop the area.
