Mihlali Ndamase has accused FlySafair of being racist. JOHANNESBURG - YouTuber Mihlali Ndamase has accused South African airline FlySafair of being racist. Taking to Instagram on Sunday, the influencer posted pictures and detailed an incident in which the company's staff members allegedly called her and her friends animals. "My friends and I were called animals by these people on @flysafairza because we were being “loud” on the flight. I didn’t know it was against the law to speak on a flight, I mean if you have an issue with hearing black people’s voices buy a private jet 🤷🏽‍♀️ I can’t believe we have to deal with such treatment in 2019 for being black, I’m so disappointed."

I can’t spend my money on a flight only to be treated like someone who’s not supposed to be on the airline, because of the colour of my skin", she wrote in the caption. Ndamase further explained that although police officers were called in to escort them out of the plane, the officers "saw absolutely NOTHING wrong" after questioning the group. "They called policemen to escort us off the flight because we questioned what the issue was with our behavior and funny enough the policemen saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with our behavior. "I tried to handle this matter with as much grace and maturity as possible but I’m outraged by how much disrespect we got from the staff of FLYSAFAIR @flysafairza." The airline company has responded to Ndamase's claims. FlySafair said it will launch a comprehensive investigation. "FlySafair will launch a comprehensive investigation into the incident and will take swift and appropriate actions in response", read the statement. "The airline is getting in touch with Mihlali Ndamase and will update this article with outcomes."
