File: African swine fever is not harmful to humans but causes haemorrhagic fever in domesticated pigs. JOHANNESBURG - An outbreak of African swine fever, a severe hemorrhagic disease of pigs, has spread to a fourth province in South Africa, the agricultural ministry said on Monday, following a spate of outbreaks last month. The ministry said the latest outbreak of the disease was reported in the Heilbron area of the central Free State Province after the disease was detected in the country's North West, Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces last month.

"Veterinary services together with the industry are conducting follow-up investigations to trace the origin of the disease and to identify other farms that may possibly be affected." The disease is incurable in pigs but harmless to humans. It has spread to China since last year, causing major losses to the world's largest hog herd.
