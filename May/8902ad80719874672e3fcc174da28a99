File: Mick Jagger reportedly had a heart valve replaced in New York last month. LONDON - British rock group the Rolling Stones announced new US and Canada tour dates after a postponement while legendary frontman Mick Jagger underwent surgery. The band said it would play all of the previously scheduled shows, starting at Chicago's Soldier Field stadium on June 21, and added a new date in New Orleans on July 14. "Looking forward to seeing you there!" 75-year-old Jagger wrote on Twitter, the day after posting a video of himself energetically rehearsing some dance moves. The flamboyant Stones founder reportedly had a heart valve replaced in New York last month, in what industry tracker Billboard described as a successful, minimally invasive procedure. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement allowed the artist to avoid major surgery that would open his chest, it said. Jagger has eight children, five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter, but has maintained his lively stage performances, playing Britain's Glastonbury Festival in 2013.

"We apologise again for any inconvenience the re-scheduling of these dates may have caused you and hope to see you at a show very soon!" the Stones said in an online statement.
