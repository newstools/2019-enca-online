eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger has the latest. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Political parties have raised concerns about voters' ability to hop from voting station to voting station on election day, and cast their vote several times. Cope MP Deirdre Carter said it was possible to cheat the system. READ: EFF disappointed in IEC after claims of double voting She visited several polling stations in the Western Cape yesterday to test the system. "Five, Six hours after voting, I went to the kitchen, grabbed the domestos … and it (the mark on her finger) was gone. I went to the voting station where I voted, went to the presiding officer, said ‘do you mind, can you scan my ID because I want to see if it is going to come through. Scanned it, no problem – it’s (her ID number) there." Carter said she was given a slip and shown through to a room where she would be allowed to vote a second time. "The second one (presiding officer) said yes, people can actually go to other voting stations and go and vote more than once." Carter went to five polling stations and in each case, she would have been able to vote several times. The IEC said it was investigating at least two instances of double voting. "The Electoral Commission would like to assure voters and all stakeholders of the overall integrity of the electoral process," said the Commissioner, Mosotho Moepya. "Fortunately the election process contains a number of checks and safeguards which together serve to protect the integrity of the process."
