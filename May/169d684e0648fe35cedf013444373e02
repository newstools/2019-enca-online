For some analysis on her findings I'm joined by Freedom Under Law, Executive Officer, Nicole Fritz. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Freedom Under Law says the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report on Pravin Gordhan is concerning. The report found released last week found that his approval of Ivan Pillay's early retirement was improper. The organisation's Nicole Fritz says this is another attempt to bring trumped-up charges against Gordhan. "Several years ago we had an attempt to charge Mr Gordhan, Mr Pillay and Mr Magashule in respect to the exact same matters that now frame the report issued by the public protector. Gordhan's lawyer: 'Mkhwebane didn't follow due process' "21 days later there was a fairly notorious climb down on the part of then NDPP Shaun Abrahams of those charges on the basis there was really no evidence supporting wrongdoing on the part of these three individuals", said Fritz. Fritz has also questioned the timing of the release of the report and says it is problematic that Gordhan was only given 48 hours to respond to the findings of the report. "Minister Gordhan has been targeted and he is seen as a potential block on those who would enable state capture. I think there are powerful political interests in this country who would like to see him not in a position of political power."
