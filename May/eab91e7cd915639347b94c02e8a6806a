The number of informal settlements is on the rise and so are households dependent on social grants. That's according to Stats SA. PRETORIA - Stats SA has revealed that the number of informal settlements is on the rise and so is households dependent on social grants. However, the stats also show that more households in the country have access to electricity, water and a flushing toilet. Formal homes have increased from eight-million in 2002 to 13-million in 2019. But, more shacks are mushrooming closer to areas of employment.

People are not willing to pay if there's an increase in relation to water, there's a decline in a number of people not willing to pay for such services. Stats SA says fewer people are going to bed hungry. However, social grants dependency is on the rise with over 44-percent of households surveyed receiving one or more grants. eNCA reporter Lirandzu Themba has more details in the video above.
