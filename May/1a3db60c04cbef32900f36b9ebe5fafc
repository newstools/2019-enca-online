Coenie Oosthuizen looks on after the Super Rugby match between the Auckland Blues of New Zealand and Coastal Sharks of South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland on April 16, 2016. LONDON - Coenie Oosthuizen became the second high profile South African rugby international within weeks to join English Premiership side Sale Sharks on Monday. The 30-year-old prop - capped 30 times since making his Test debut against England in 2012 - signed a three-year contract and will join Sharks after the conclusion of the 2019 Super Rugby season.

"Coenie joining us, along with Lood is a huge statement of where we want to be," said Sale's director of rugby Steve Diamond in a club statement. "He is 130kg, can play on both sides of the scrum and has a skill set away from the set piece that is unique for a prop of his size. "He also has considerable experience playing with (hooker) Akker Van Der Merwe at the Sharks so I think he will fit in perfectly at Sale."
