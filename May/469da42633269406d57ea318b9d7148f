Party leader Mmusi Maimane says it's time the NPA investigates Magashule for wrongdoing. "We cannot be living in a country where corruption is allowed to thrive. Corrupt politicians must end up in jail for 15 years and therefore I’m happy that the NPA took the dossier." The documents detail information about, among others, the controversial Vrede Dairy Farm project and a R1-billion housing project which never came to fruition. READ: Magashule considering legal action against Myburgh The DA says its been in possession of the evidence since last year. Maimane says Magashule appears to be unfazed by the DA's move because, "he has captured his party. He knows if they increase their support, he'll come to parliament and they will continue to capture organs of state that will not prosecute him". The DA leader said he was confident that the newly appointed National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi, would investigate his evidence. Magashule has been making the headlines following a book by investigative journalist Pieter Louis-Myburgh.

The ANC Secretary-General has since denied the allegations, saying the book is nothing but a question on his political credentials. He said he was considering legal action against Myburgh.
