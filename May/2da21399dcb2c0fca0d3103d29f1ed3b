EFF leader has responded after South African comedian and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah sparked anger from some quarters on social media when he compared Malema with US President Donald Trump this past weekend. BRAAMFONTEIN - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema urged South Africans to continue to love Trevor Noah and to laugh at his jokes. The South African-born Daily Show Host sparked anger from EFF followers on social media, after he compared Malema with US President Donald Trump. In the video tweet, which he later deleted, Noah said, "If you think Trump is bad, wait until you see how Julius treats the press". He later played video clips of Malema speaking about not killing white people and commented, "He (Malema) speaks about genocide, like he's remodeling his kitchen". READ: Trevor Noah sparks anger with Malema comments During a media briefing in Johannesburg on Thursday, the EFF leader said Noah was free to say what he wanted. "Let him say whatever he wants to say about me ... about the EFF. It's a free country. We still wish him well. "He doesn’t know me and a lot of people don’t know me and they draw a lot of conclusion about me,” Malema said. Malema said while he would continue to support Noah, he hoped that the comedian wasn't pushing an agenda. “We hope his joke was made genuinely not because he was trying to appease his masters at Tuynhuis. I hope that is not what influenced him and I will continue to watch him and South Africans should continue to watch him.”
