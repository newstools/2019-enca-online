Amajita coach Thabo Senong. JOHANNESBURG - Amajita were no match for Argentina in their opening U-20 Fifa World Cup game in Poland. Ten-man South Africa suffered a 5-2 defeat after conceding their first goal within the first four minutes of play. READ: We are disappointed - SA Under-20 coach Senong Amajita’s Keenan Phillips equalised for a one-all tied first half. A VAR call gave the South Americans a penalty in the second half before yet another call saw Phillips get his marching orders in the 66th minute. AS Monaco striker, Lyle Foster, also got on the score sheet, but the six-time champions were too strong as they sealed a resounding victory to lead Group F.
