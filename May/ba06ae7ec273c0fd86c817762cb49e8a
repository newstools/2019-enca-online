We need change that stops corruption and puts a job in every home. Vote DA 8 May".   "We bought advertising space there on the digital billboard. A billboard is for the purposes of conveying a political message of campaigning and that billboard showcases our message of how Luthuli House has become an assembly of corruption because of the unethical leadership that occupies leadership positions within the ANC", said Democratic Alliance Spokesperson Solly Malatsi.

"We believe that the digital billboard complies with all the electoral campaigning regulations that are formalised by the IEC," Malatsi added.
