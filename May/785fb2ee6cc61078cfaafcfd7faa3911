File: Daily Show host and comedian Trevor Noah has criticised the IAAF for trying to force Caster Semenya to lower her testosterone levels. JOHANNESBURG - Trevor Noah has backed South African athlete Caster Semenya, telling his The Daily Show audience that the best athletes have genetic advantages. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ruled that Semenya should take hormone-suppressing treatment to lower her testosterone levels. The athlete says she refuses to do so. "I don't know what will happen next. But no-one should tell me what to do, if people want to stop me from doing something that's their problem, not mine," she said.

"It's not like she's doping. She didn't change her body in any way to gain an advantage. She just has a natural advantage, which is what happens in all sport." He went on to say that the best athletes often have a unique genetic advantage that give them the edge.

"Shaq is so tall he can put a ball in a hoop without jumping. How is that fair, huh?"
