Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing MP Themba Godi has described his party's loss of its only seat in the National Assembly as a setback. The African People's Convention will meet on SaturdayÂ to discuss its future. The party says it's determined to pursue its African agenda from outside Parliament. Godi said the party would meet in Johannesburg to "verbalise the digestion" of the loss of the parliamentary seat. The leader said the party has set out their plan for the future outside of parliament and remained positive about his party's campaigning despite the loss. Godi was a long-serving chairperson of Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
