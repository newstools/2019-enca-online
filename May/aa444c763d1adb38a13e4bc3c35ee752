The indelible ink is one of a number of security checks and safeguards built into election process,” said IEC CEO, Sy Mamabolo. “The commission wishes to remind all voters that any attempt to undermine the integrity of the electoral process, including attempting to remove the indelible ink constitute an electoral offence, which is punishable upon conviction by sentence of 10-years in jail,” he added.
