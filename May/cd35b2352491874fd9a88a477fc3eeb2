The body of 21-year-old Naledi Lethoba was found in an open field and was identified by her parents. Welkom police cluster commander Lerato Molale says her body was found in a 'shocking state' as her breasts had been cut off and a knife was stuck in her neck. "The body was badly burnt, a knife was stuck in the neck and it was just lying around there in the trees, hence I am saying she was murdered in a spine chilling manner", said Molale.

"He was not from the same campus as Naledi, he was studying somewhere and at the same time I would like to thank parents of the suspect as well as the investigating team who uncovered that he was the suspect." Molale says the video circulating on social media allegedly showing Naledi's horrific murder is false and the origins of the specific video are not known. "The video doing rounds is not part of the suspect, we do not know it, it originates from somewhere." The motive for the murder is unknown and the suspect is expected to appear in court on June 21 for a formal bail application.
