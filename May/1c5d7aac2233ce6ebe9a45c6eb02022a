"Somehow we have to convince them he has no money. I think they've got it in their head that there is money and their minds are fixed," Dr Sooliman said. The Gift of the Givers are getting messages from religious leaders to appeal to the kidnappers on religious grounds but Sooliman stated that is not anticipated to work as they do not act out of religious fervour but for profit.
