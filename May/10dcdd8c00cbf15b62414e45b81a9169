Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The bailout of the Daybreak poultry farm was in focus at the PIC inquiry on Wednesday. Royith Rajdhar, a former Daybreak non-executive board member and PIC employee, testified he saw the potential in the farm after looking at its assets and liabilities. WATCH: PIC inquiry continues as allegations pile up The PIC was originally a 54 percent shareholder in Daybreak. The organisation gradually invested to the point where it is the 100 percent owner. Rajdhar told the commission that the only reason why the PIC took over 100 percent of Daybreak was as a result of the company being in jeopardy.

Rajdhar said he understands acquiring shares in Daybreak was a stressed asset; despite all the troubles the PIC continued to believe it was worth it.
