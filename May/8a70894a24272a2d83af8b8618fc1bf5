File: Eminem's music company Eight Mile was awarded NZ$600,000 ($393,840) in damages in 2017 after a court ruled the use of the track was a breach of copyright.

The Court of Appeal later reduced that amount to NZ$225,000 and Eight Mile appealed to the Supreme Court. "We have considered these points carefully but we are not persuaded that they are matters of public importance or general commercial significance that would justify a further appeal," the Supreme Court said in its ruling. The track, played during the centre-right National Party's successful 2014 election campaign and titled "Eminem Esque", was found by a lower court to have "substantially copied" Lose Yourself.

The Supreme Court ordered Eight Mile pay the National Party NZ$4,500 in costs.
