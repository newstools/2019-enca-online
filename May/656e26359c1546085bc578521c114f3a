Courtesy #DStV403 DURBAN - The damage caused to the collapsed Mobeni water reservoir in Durban has been preliminarily estimated at R50-million. On Saturday morning the structure was partially destroyed and millions of litres of water were lost. The municipality initially blamed a bomb attack amid a municipal worker strike but later retracted the statement. READ: Durban reservoir damaged; many areas without water Water supply in the area was not affected. “No major supply was interrupted because this reservoir has three compartments so one compartment was damaged but the other two are intact so what we have done is to reroute a supply to one compartment and we are getting the other one ready to ease the load on the one that is functional,” Nkosenhle Madlala from eThekwini Municipality. READ: Uncertainty over cause of Durban reservoir damage Striking municipal workers were alleged to have been responsible for sabotaging the structure but members of trade union Samwu deny any involvement, saying the reservoir was simply too old. “The reservoir itself was in need of repairs it was too old and remember there have been some floods here in Durban recently probably it overflowed to an extent that it ended being like this,” said Samwu’s Jaycee Ncanana. An investigation into what exactly caused the damage is underway.
