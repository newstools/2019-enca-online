Cyclone Kenneth struck while Mozambique was still struggling to deal with the impact of Cyclone Idai. Meanwhile, cholera cases have been confirmed in northern Mozambique following floods caused by a powerful cyclone that battered the country last week, provincial authorities said on Friday.

"We were already prepared for that - the health care sector has been on the alert since Cyclone Kenneth started," the provincial health director, Anastacia Lidimo, told reporters. Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in northern Cabo Delgado province on April 25, packing winds up to 220 kilometres per hour - hitting a region that has not experienced a tropical cyclone in the modern era. It killed at least 41 people, with some 226,000 affected, destroyed thousands of homes and wrecked water supply systems.
