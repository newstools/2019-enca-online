ANC’s head of elections Fikile Mbalula speaks during an interview with the media at the ROC in Tshwane JOHANNESBURG - ANC members Fikile Mbalula, Carl Niehaus and Derek Hanekom set Twitter alight in a post-election twar on Wednesday. The twar appears to have started as election results were coming in on 10 May, when Mbalula and the ANC's Secretary-General Ace Magashule voiced different views on who was responsible for leading the party to victory. In a news briefing at the Results Centre, Magashule said that the ANC wasn't about any individual, but rather about the party as a whole and its voters. Niehaus tweeted a video of that briefing, showing his support for Magashule. Niehaus went on to tweet a statement saying he was glad that the "SG dismissed his (Mbalula's) utter nonsense statement that the ANC vote would have gone down to 40% if President Ramaphosa was not elected president of the ANC". Mbalula reportedly responded by saying that Magashule should not be "allergic" about Ramaphosa, saying that the president was the game-changer for the ANC. On Wednesday, Niehaus called Mbalula a coward after the former police minister seemingly blocked him on twitter. WATCH: Calls for a strong Ramaphosa Cabinet Niehaus tweeted, "He (Mbalula) seems to fear much, especially engagement about his blatant opportunism, careerism & lack of respect for his seniors, such as the SG of the ANC, comrade Ace Magashule. Talk about real cowardice!" WATCH: All eyes on Ramaphosa’s next Cabinet  Mbalula, not one to stay silent on such attacks, hit back at Niehaus calling him a "crook" and questioned his business at Luthuli House. Tourism minister Derek Hanekom also got stuck into Niehaus. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa declined to comment on the war of words between the three ANC members.
