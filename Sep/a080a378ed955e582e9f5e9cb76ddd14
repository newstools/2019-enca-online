Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The AmaZulu King says he’s ready to defend his land and is prepared to go to court to do so. The Ingonyama Trust Act places almost 2,8 million hectares of land in KwaZulu-Natal under the control of King Goodwill Zwelethini. But the advisory panel on land reform has recommended the act be repealed or reviewed. King Zwelithini: Time running out on land issue The Zulu monarch was addressing thousands of maidens at Enyokeni Royal Palace in KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday, as part of the annual reed dance festivities. “It is sad that today one hundred and forty years after defending our land at the battle of Isandlwana and after more than a century of being at the forefront of the liberation movement to fight against the worst system apartheid which was defined as a crime against humanity by the United Nations, and after twenty five years of being part of the democratic dispensation in South Africa, we are vilified for being who we are. This vilification has resulted in what can be constructively be referred as Zulu phobia.” The King seems also not to have abandoned the idea of secession. “We are prepared to be part of the solution and part of South Africa. But, if there are those who are calling for us to be on our own, they must come clean and out in the open because we are just waiting for them.”
