"Normally, that culture comes from a team that has been playing together regularly and has won," Pienaar said. Pienaar said since 1987, winning teams at the world cup had a core group of players from a successful provincial rugby team, naming the Bulls and Sharks players who represented SA in 2007.

Leadership, management of leadership, a strong pack, and some luck are a few of the other elements Pienaar named for a winning side. Pienaar said South Africa has a great chance coming into the competition. "We definitely have a very good chance to win this World Cup but it's going to depend on how we handle pressure and how we execute our gameplan come match day," Pienaar said. Pienaar emphasised the positive change sport can effect nationally saying, "we love winning, we absolutely love winning in this country and we can be the hardest critics if we don't because our passion for our team is enormous."
