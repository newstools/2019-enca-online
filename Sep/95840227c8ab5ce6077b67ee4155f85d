They’ve won all seven encounters against the Tongans. There’s 13/2 on England by 31-35 points and the same price for England 46-50. Take 8/1 if you fancy England 26-30. There’s 9/10 either way being offered on the Total Points being odd or even for the fixture and the same price for the First Half Odd/Even Points market. One market that does catch the eye for this match is the price offered on the chances of a red card. If you think there might be one then you can take 7/1. It’s a speculative one but here’s why. Of the 17 red cards that have been dished out at the Rugby World Cup, three of them have been handed to Tonga players, one of those coming against England. That was during a game where they were on the receiving end of a thrashing. Frustrations might just flare up again in what looks to be a very difficult contest for the Tongans to start their campaign in. England are ranked as the world’s third best side according to the world rankings and Tonga are 15th. It’s hard to imagine this fixture will turn out to be competitive. Instead it will likely be a case of England trying to show early on in the tournament that they mean business. Click here for a full range of betting options available on this fixture.
