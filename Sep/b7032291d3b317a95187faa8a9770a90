The former Proteas opening batsman is urging parents to get their priorities right when supporting their children in school sport. JOHANNESBURG - Former Proteas Coach Gary Kirsten believes children are facing a lot of pressure when playing school sport. School sport is often a key stage for the development of future stars, but the winning mentality often creates added pressure on these players. He's embarked on a series of programmes to help parents support their children better as they build their sporting careers. “I think I’ve been through the entire circle, been the schoolboy, then the professional, then the coach and now the parent. It’s a tough journey for a parent and obviously there’s a lot of emotional investment into it. I think it’s also just to understand what are ... the pitfalls, what one needs to be aware of, really just to understand the role that schoolboy sport does play.” He's warned that the win-at-all-costs approach can affect pupils in the long run. Kirsten says parents should get their priorities right. "... is it for the school to win games or is it for the actual development of the kids to prepare them for what they going to be faced with ... I think it is important that the values that come out of a sporting career at school, allow for each one of those children to develop holistically in their education process.”
