Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - After almost two years of waiting for justice, families of the Life Esidimeni victims will now have to wait for the outcomes of an inquest. READ: NPA to hold inquest into Life Esidimeni The National Prosecution Authority said they do not have enough evidence to take the issue to court and has set up a formal inquest to look into the tragedy. Christine Nxumalo from the Life Esidimeni Family Committee and a sister of one of the deceased said it is frustrating and shared the feelings of the rest of the families. Nxumalo said while the families are angry and upset; they know there is nothing they can do besides go along with the NPA's decision. READ: Still no arrests in Life Esidimeni tragedy The NPA met with the parents to explain the need for the inquest, saying instigating a criminal case needs ample evidence to avoid being thrown out of court. According to Nxumalo, the families were able to accept the explanation. She said in response to a question of whether she believes the families will obtain justice, "we don't know. We can only hope, all we can do is push."
