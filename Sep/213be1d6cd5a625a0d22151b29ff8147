The changes were negotiated at the National Economic Development and Labour Council. The  South African Federation of Trade Unions has rejected the change saying it infringes on workers right. WATCH: Saftu planning 2019 national shutdown Saftu General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, has warned that workers won't allow their rights to be diluted. "We are taking this on and we are mobilising." "These amendments are designed by a capitalist, bourgeoisie state acting at the behest of the ruling elite. All of this undermines the spirit of the constitution." Workers are prepared to go all the way to the Constitutional Court to fight for their right to strike without a secret ballot. Recent legal changes require unions to have a secret ballot in which workers can decide whether they want to strike.
