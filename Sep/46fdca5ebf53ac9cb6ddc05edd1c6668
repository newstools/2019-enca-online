(L-R) Wales' Rhys Carre, Ryan Elias, Hadleigh Parkes and Aled Davies pass the ball during a rugby demonstration for children during a visit to Sokakan Junior High School in Toyota City on September 20, 2019, ahead of their Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup opening match against Georgia on September 23. TOYOTA CITY, Japan - Skills coach Neil Jenkins insisted Wales were "ready to rock" at the Rugby World Cup as Stephen Jones joined the backroom staff after Rob Howley's shock departure over betting allegations. Jones, who was due to replace Howley after the World Cup, has minimal time to prepare after Warren Gatland's long-time attack coach flew home to face an investigation. But Jenkins insisted Jones, the former Wales and British and Irish Lions fly-half, was slotting right in ahead of Wales's Pool D opener against Georgia on Monday.

"He pretty much knows how it works. He's a fantastic person and I think he knows a lot of the systems we play and he will get into it pretty quickly. "Pretty much everything has been put in place for Monday - it has been for some time - and we are ready to rock on that. We will just keep moving forward." Howley's departure sent shockwaves through the Wales camp, where he has been a fixture since 2008 and an integral part of their success under Gatland. "It is obviously very difficult. He (Howley) is a very close friend of mine. It's not ideal, but it is what it is. It's happened and we have to move forward," Jenkins said. "Steve has arrived here now and he is a good man as well. The boys have trained well. It's the same as anything - the show goes on, and we have got to look forward and try and put it behind us."
