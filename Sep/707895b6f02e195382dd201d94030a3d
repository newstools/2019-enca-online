The NSPCA says the route and climatic conditions of the voyage would be very stressful for the animals. The council says government won't allow the animals to be loaded. READ: Renewed calls to ban wild animal interaction Marcelle Meredith, an executive director at the National Council of SPCAs says the animals would suffer as humans would do. "We have a responsibility in a recent line bowing case the argument and we won the high court argument is that anybody who is allowing export permits would be the government must take the welfare of the animals into account and I do believe that right now as we speak our government is taking the welfare of the animal into account.” “They will not allow those animals to be loaded, the ship is currently inside our territorial waters but it is waiting for the go-ahead to come into port if it does into port that still doesn’t mean that government has given them the go-ahead.”
