File: South African Airways Pilots' Association says meetings have not produced the desired results. JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) pilots have threatened to go on strike if changes don’t take place at the airline. Earlier this year, the SAA Pilots’ Association organised an independent service provider to conduct a survey on conditions at work. The feedback was scathing with 91 percent of pilots responding that operations management was either poor or extremely poor, while 96 percent were in favour of taking a stand to force change at the airline. SAAPA says meetings have not produced the desired results.
