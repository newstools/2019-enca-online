SPONSORED We’re still at that stage of the Rugby World Cup where trying to find a real game to have a bet on seems to be few and far between. Case in point is the clash between Italy and Canada in Fukuoka City. It’s a game that sees the world’s 14th best side according to the rankings meet a team ranked 22nd. In a group that includes New Zealand and South Africa it’s a surprise to see Italy topping the table. Now it isn’t much to get excited over and there’s hardly any thought of them somehow going through the pool stage. Their current position is simply due to the fact that they handed Namibia a big defeat in their opener and their superior points difference has them on top. It’s one of the reasons why Italy are 1/2 to take the Full Time Result against the 9/1 offered on Canada’s chances of causing an upset. For handicap backers, there’s 9/10 on Italy (-19.5) vs Canada (+19.5) and even money on Italy (-20.5) vs Canada (+18.5). Looking for an early interest soon after kick off?
