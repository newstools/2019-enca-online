JOHANNESBURG - Senior journalist at the Tiso Blackstar Group, Ranjeni Munusamy, has been placed on special leave following revelations at the state capture inquiry that a crime intelligence slush fund was used to pay for her car . Senior Hawks Investigator Kobus Roelofse testified that over R140,000 was paid into a vehicle finance account in 2008 to settle Munusamy's vehicle payment. He told the commission that he discovered the payment during an investigation into crime intelligence officers and car dealership, Atlantis Motors. The company said an internal investigation will begin.

"However, we have granted her special leave considering the gravity of these allegations. The editor of the Sunday Times, Bongani Siqoko, commenced with internal investigations on Wednesday as soon as the commission notified Munusamy of these allegations". According to TimesLive, Munusamy has denied the allegations and said she will defend herself against them.
