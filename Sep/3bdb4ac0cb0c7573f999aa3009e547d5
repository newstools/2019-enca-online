Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South Africans are divided about convicted drug mule Nolubabalo "Babsie" Nobanda's high profile welcome back home. READ: SA drug mule, caught with cocaine in dreadlocks, heading home Nobanda responded to the criticism in an exclusive interview with Checkpoint's Sebe Buthelezi. She said she doesn't think people have been congratulating her for her actions but those who support her, understand people make mistakes. "It's a chance for others to understand where they can go wrong, what to avoid." "I want my life to be about, don't be like Babsie, watch out. Don't be so naive," Nobanda said. She stated she would be starting in her own community, empowering people with information on how to avoid making the same mistakes.
