Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - AfriForum's Ernst Roets feels vindicated by the dismissal of a contempt of court case against him. The Nelson Mandela Foundation laid charges against him for tweeting a picture of South Africa's old flag, shortly after the Equality Court had ruled its gratuitous display constitutes hate speech. The Foundation wanted Roets sanctioned for his tweet. But Roets argued that it was part of his research. He claims Tuesday's verdict is no surprise. The NMF is planning to appeal the ruling. But it insists people's right to dignity must be respected. “I think it’s important to reflect not just today in SA on our history, how many people have gone through the pain of apartheid, which is represented by this flag, and therefore what are we going to do to move forward,” said NMF's communications director,Luzuko Koti.
