Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma's wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma is considering taking legal action against the police. The National Prosecuting Authority has decided not to prosecute anyone for the alleged poisoning of her husband. The Acting Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal, Elaine Zungu says the State Security Agency's report contains no evidence Zuma was poisoned. READ: Gavin was an amazing friend to me: Jacob Zuma Zungu also says that Zuma himself has not submitted an affidavit so he cannot be referred to as the complainant. Ntuli-Zuma's lawyer, Ulrich Roux says her client was thrown out of the Nkandla homestead in January 2015, after claims she plotted to poison him. Her lawyer says it's a shame it took South African Police Service so long to determine that there's not a shred of evidence linking her to the alleged crime. “A letter that we have received now dated 13 September 2019 confirms that there is not even a shred of evidence to show that there was an attempt to poison Jacob Zuma and by whom, there is no one linked to any attempt to poison him,”Roux said. “Certainly someone is lying at the NPA.”
