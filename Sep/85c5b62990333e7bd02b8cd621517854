During a dialogue held by the Department of Home Affairs, leaders from various faiths said it was important that no was left behind. Currently, South African marriages are governed by 3 pieces of legislation: the Marriage Act, Customary Marriage Act and the Civil Union Act. READ: Home Affairs wants better marriage legislation “The act doesn’t cover Muslim marriages, it doesn’t cover Jewish marriages, it doesn’t cover Hindu marriages but you also become immediately aware that certain aspects of traditional marriages are not covered despite the amendment we made to customary marriages act”, said Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. The Home Affairs Minister believes updated legislation could help curb a high divorce rate. The department hopes to finalise the new act by 2021.
