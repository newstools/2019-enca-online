Thousands of Zulu maidens took part in the annual reed dance in KwaZulu-Natal. The maidens presented reeds to King Goodwill Zwelithini at his Enyokeni palace in Nongoma, as a symbol of their virginity. The cultural event spans over a week.

We cannot meet without speaking against this evil, for it is taking the lives of those we have been tasked to protect.” Zwelithini says the world is laughing at us because we are fighting each other.
