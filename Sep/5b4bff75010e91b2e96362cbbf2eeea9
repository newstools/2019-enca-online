The ANC's top six will meet with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni over his economic recovery plan. The top brass is also expected to discuss Zandile Gumede who revoked his resignation as eThekwini mayor. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Political Analyst Prince Mashele has expressed scepticism over the economic strategy plan drafted by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Mboweni released the 77-page document for public comment. The plan proposes reviewing regulations on everything from fuel to banking and suggests ways to get more tourists and immigrants into the country as South Africa battles with a contracting economy. Mashele says the government has presented too many failed plans. WATCH: Mboweni's economic plan drafted by consultants: EFF Mashele says more needs to be done to fix the ANC, which he describes as being in a mess. “If you think of it, how many economic strategies have we been treated to as a nation over the past five years, too many,” Mashele said. “You have the National Development plan, where is it? We were told at some point that it was going to solve all our problems. There was a thing called stimulus package, where is it? “Now there's a new economic strategy, I don't have faith in this because you can't keep on feeding the nation with economic strategies, have one strategy, implement it and see things turning around." READ: Mantashe criticises Mboweni's recovery plan The ANC’s alliance partners Cosatu and the SACP, who are staunch Ramaphosa supporters have expressed disapproval on Mboweni’s plan. Mashele has says the alliance partners are weak in determining matters in the ANC. “They have been seriously weakened, I don’t think the president worries about them. He worries about co-opting a few individuals, Blade Nzimande and a few chaps,” Mashele said.
