Scotland and Ireland players shake hands after the match. YOKOHAMA - Top-ranked Ireland put aside their stuttering 2019 form with a clinical 27-3 victory over their main Pool A rivals Scotland to open their World Cup campaign in convincing style in Yokohama on Sunday. Forwards James Ryan, Rory Best and Tadhg Furlong all crossed in the first 25 minutes and winger Andrew Conway secured the bonus point with the fourth try in the second half. READ: Rugby World Cup referees under fire on opening weekend Scotland, who had a single Greig Laidlaw penalty to show for their efforts, tried to get their expansive running game going but were hamstrung first by the Irish defence and then the slippery conditions caused by a persistent drizzle. There will be a concern that injury-prone flyhalf Johnny Sexton gave up the kicking duties early on, and overhead injuries to flanker Peter O'Mahony and centre Bundee Aki, but the Irish will move on confidently to their next match against hosts Japan.
