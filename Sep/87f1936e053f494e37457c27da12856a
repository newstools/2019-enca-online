Whether they were white or black, they would link me to Yeoville. They would talk about drugs. It uses to be funny in the beginning but then I realised it’s not so funny," said Guild of Nigerians representative, Adetunji Omotola. Omotola believes South African laws aren't strict enough. Other immigrants, from the south of Nigeria, say they'd leave South Africa if the situation at home were to change. President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned the widespread attacks on foreign nationals, calling them unjustified.
