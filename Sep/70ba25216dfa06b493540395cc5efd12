READ: New eThekwini mayor elected Service delivery and cleaning up the inner city are at the top of his agenda. "Part of what we will be dealing with, in next few 100 days that we have as a start up, will be ensuring that we clean our city and calling upon our residents to partake in this programme. To ascertain that in areas where we have illegal dumping, we actually address that by deploying adequate personnel to deal with that particular issue", said Kaunda.
