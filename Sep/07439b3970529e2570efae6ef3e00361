Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's crime statistics paint a bleak picture of an angry country where people have low impulse control. On Thursday, the police for the first time broke down the motives behind murders. Over 21,000 people were killed in South Africa during the last financial year. More than 1,700 murders were committed as a result of arguments and misunderstandings. Crime Stats: 58 people killed a day in SA The Western Cape leads, followed by Mpumalanga, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and the Eastern Cape Experts say the problem is these crimes are hard to police because they're unpredictable. “The question is what can we as citizens do and what can we expect from our government. And certainly preventing government is going to involve citizens, NGOs, government and the private sector. We all have to start imagining a future that is different to what we have now. Which means we need to move away from our anger and fear, which is legitimate at the moment but we need to say, let’s imagine what this would look like if it were different," said Chandré Gould, senior research fellow in the Crime and Justice Division of the Institute for Security Studies.
