BLF Spokesperson, Lindsay Maasdorp, described the tragedy as a suitable punishment for white people and their children. He said he'd only mourn the tragedy if the victims were black. Party president, Andile Mngxitama, defended Maasdorp's statement. Solidarity laid the charge on behalf of the victim's parents.
