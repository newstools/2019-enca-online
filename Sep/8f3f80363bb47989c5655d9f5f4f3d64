READ: SA's GDP buoyant in second quarter “The medium-term inflation outlook is largely unchanged. The inflation forecast generated by the SARB’s Quarterly Projection Model is for headline inflation to average 4.2% in 2019 (down from 4.4%).” Kganayago said that the MPC was pleased about the sustained moderation in inflation. “The Committee would like to see inflation expectations also anchored closer to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum,” he said. Kganyago said forecast of GDP growth for 2019 remains unchanged at 0.6%.
