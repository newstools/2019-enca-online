Now, 10 smaller, more agile grass fire vehicles are being added to that number. “The renewal of the City’s EMS fleet, which includes fire and rescue vehicles, is a long-awaited and much-needed service delivery initiative which will directly impact in the lives of our residents,” Mashaba said. “In the coming months, we expect to add over 90 EMS vehicles to our existing fleet. This is unprecedented in the City of Johannesburg.” READ: Mashaba: I have no reason to apologise for xenophobic violence Mashaba says the city has managed to save money on the new vehicles. Meanwhile, 103 suspended firefighters are now back at work while 127 of their colleagues remain at home.
