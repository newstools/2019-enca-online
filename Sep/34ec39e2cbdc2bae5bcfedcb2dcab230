Amcu's president says new striking laws have been created to stifle the union's growth – and must be fought at all costs. Courtesy #DStv403 BOKSBURG – Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa said new striking laws have been created to stifle the union's growth – and must be fought at all costs. Mathunjwa was responding to legislation requiring a secret ballot before a strike can take place. He is expected to be re-elected as president at the mining union’s elective conference, underway in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. Calls for worker unity dominated the start of Amcu’s long-awaited conference.

Vavi’s call was met with roaring cheers from delegates. “Workers need each other more than any other time in the history of this country,” Vavi said. “In unity and not in competition with one another. Otherwise, they will be laughing at us until we are in our graves. Saftu without unity with Amcu is weak.” Mathunjwa said the new laws are an attack on Amcu. “Is it a coincidence that they make sure that in six months the constitution should be changed before we exercise our rights to strike?” READ: Amcu locked in wage dispute with Anglo-American Reflecting on the road to the conference, Mathunjwa said Amcu found an enemy in its own ranks. “The enemy was within. Not only at <the> branch or regional level, but also at <a> national level,” he said. Amcu’s new national leadership will be announced on Friday night.
