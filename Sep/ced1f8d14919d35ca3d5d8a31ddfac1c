File: ANC Women's League president Bathabile Dlamini. JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's women's league is calling for a national stay away this week, against gender-based violence.
The league says violence against women is a national crisis and it wants to send a strong message - even if it means disrupting the economy. READ: Dlamini issues veiled threat to ANC Pickets and marches have been planned throughout the country. The call comes after a spate of deadly attacks against women. This was spurred on by the killing of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana. Mrwetyana was laid to rest on Saturday.
