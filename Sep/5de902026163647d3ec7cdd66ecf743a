eNCA speaks to Capitec's CEO, Gerrie Fourie. #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - Capitec is bucking the banking retrenchment trend as it plans to employ 600 new workers. That's as it's reported a 20 percent jump in interim profits. Capitec has also increased the number of clients using its digital services, from 4.7 million to 6.8 million. WATCH: Unions to urgently appeal strike interdict The uptick in digital banking has been cited as one reason why banks are reducing their floor space and retrenching staff. But Capitec says its digital expansion is actually creating the need to hire more people. It added 200-thousand new clients a month over the past six months and now has 12.6 million active customers.
