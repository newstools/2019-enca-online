And at every turn that you interact with femininity – there is an attempt to steal that autonomy – like in mainstream media – it says what we should look like, our hair and lips. And now this is the final frontier of what should happen with your body." READ: Sisters in court over illegal abortions Flyers and signs for what is most likely illegal abortion services – continue to appear on the streets. The public can visit the Voices and Choices exhibition until the 25 October – where artists are bringing real stories to life. It is hoped this will make people begin thinking about the issue, and have frank and open discussions about it.
