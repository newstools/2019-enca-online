Kearyn Baccus of Kaizer Chiefs FC challenges Sphesihle Maduna of AmaZulu FC during the Absa Premiership 2019/20 football match between Amazulu and Kaizer Chiefs at King Zwelithini Stadium on 24 September 2019. JOHANNESBURG - Colombian Leonardo Castro and Zimbabwean Khama Billiat scored late goals as Kaizer Chiefs beat AmaZulu 2-0 Tuesday to regain the Absa Premiership leadership. Chiefs and Polokwane City have 13 points and plus-four goal differences after six rounds with the Soweto club occupying first place because they have scored three goals more. Bottom-of-the-table AmaZulu had two goals ruled offside before a capacity 10,000 Heritage Day holiday crowd in Durban before Chiefs took the lead on 84 minutes. A Bernard Parker free-kick rebounded off the woodwork to substitute Castro, who controlled the ball expertly under pressure and poked it into the net. It was the first goal this season for the South American and Billiat also notched his first by racing clear and firing past goalkeeper Siyabonga Mbatha three minutes into stoppage time.

They welcomed back goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune after a long injury absence and the South African international pulled off several superb saves when the match was goalless. AmaZulu sacked coach Cavin Johnson last week after securing only two points from a possible 15 since the season kicked off and the Chiefs match marked the debut of Slovak Jozef Vukusic. Vukusic exceeded expectations with Polokwane last season by guiding them to fifth -Â their highest Premiership placing.
