Motha's leg was amputated when he was 11-years-old after being diagnosed with bone cancer. He had dreams of being a professional soccer player but quickly realised that he wouldn't be able to pursue this dream. He joined the Vuyani Dance Theatre last year and found his passion.

As I was dancing too much behind the decks, you know. So I ended up loving dancing", said Motha. Motha faces some difficulties as a disabled dancer. "The challenge that I have with just grabbing the choreography. For two abled bodies to catch something, it can take them two seconds, for me it's going to take me 10 seconds you know. That's only the difference. Apart from that, I'm perfect. Motha is headed to New York to gain international exposure and pursue his dream of dancing with the stars.
