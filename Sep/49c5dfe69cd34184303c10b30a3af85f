READ: Still no arrests in Life Esidimeni tragedy The NPA received dockets in 2017 and assembled a team to collect more information and build a case. NPA spokesperson Pindi Mjonondwane said there is not enough evidence at the moment to prove a prima facie case. Mjonondwane said there is uncertainty on the causes of death in relation to the unlawful acts of the roleplayers. She stated with all the facts and evidence found and considered, the NPA is still not ready to present the matter before the court and subsequently requested the inquest. An inquiry led by former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke concluded in 2018 found that government acted in breach of the law which ultimately resulted in the deaths of 144 psychiatric patients.
