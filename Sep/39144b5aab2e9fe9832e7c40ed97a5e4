Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority said it had not ruled out prosecuting officials implicated in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. 144 psychiatric patients died after being moved from the hospital to under-equipped NGOs. The prosecuting authority's acting director George Baloyi explained why it made the decision to recommended a formal inquest to be presided over by a North Gauteng High Court Judge. READ: NPA declines to prosecute Life Esidimeni officials "We never said that no government official is implicated. We want to approach this matter very carefully and at this stage, we think that it should rather be referred to an inquest so that we can apply our minds to determine," said Baloyi. Meanwhile, the families of the 144 Life Esidimeni victims who died in the tragedy say they just want closure. They had hoped the latest legal action by the NPA would unravel the truth and bring justice.
