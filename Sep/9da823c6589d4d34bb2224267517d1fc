The Springboks are in Japan, tackling some of the world's toughest rugby opponents. JOHANNESBURG - The Springboks are hoping to make sushi of their opponents during the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The Boks are in Yokohama for their crunch game against the mighty All Blacks on Saturday. That may be on the other side of the world, but if you can’t make it … you have to fake it. eNCA's Michael Marillier will help you to learn how to watch rugby like a Japanese fan. Get ready for ‘sukuramu’, ‘takkuru’, ‘doroppugoru’ and the man everyone loves to hate, the ‘shinpan’. We’ll cut through the lexicon like a karate chop through timber … making you the ‘black belt’ of Bok fans.  Everyone wants to be in Japan at the moment but if you can't get there, there are other options to feel the magic. Courtesy of #DStv403
