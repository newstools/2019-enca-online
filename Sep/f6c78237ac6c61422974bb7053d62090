A scathing judgment by the Labour Court says the Tshwane University of Technology has failed to reverse the ills of apartheid. JOHANNESBURG - A former professional nurse working at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) says he was forced to leave the job he loves because of racial inequality over pay. A scathing judgment by the Labour Court says the TUT has failed to reverse the ills of apartheid, by continuing to pay white employees more than their black counterparts. Labour union Nehawu says at least 100 black employees are earning less than their colleagues. READ: The truth about the gender pay gap "I fought it very hard and I was prepared to run that marathon," said Nurse Paul Maraba. "But ... it did a lot of damage, because I had to resign because my dignity was impacted. I could not see myself continue working in an environment where somebody is earning more than me, somebody is less qualified than me, but they are enjoying the perks." Labour Court Acting Judge, Sandile Mabaso found that TUT didn't have a valid reason for such discrimination. He ordered that the salaries of the three be increased retroactively, back to April 2011.

"The Vaal University, TUT, University of Pretoria, Fort Hare, Unisa, Nelson Mandela. Issues of transformation are prevalent in this sector," said Tshepo Mokheranyane from Nehawu. So what if you have a similar problem at work? "You must establish a prima facie case… Most companies have rules that you can't discuss your salaries, but it's absolutely against the law... You must ask your peers what they are being paid,"  said labour law expert Andrew Levy. TUT is to appeal the judgment.
