The SIU has identified 11 irregular contracts that milked millions from the public broadcaster.
SIU head, Andy Mothibi said, "the value of the litigation matters and the value derived from the contract values is just over R560-million."
Among those labelled to have illegally benefited is former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The SIU said it has evidence he essentially gave himself bonuses for doing his job.
Mothibi explained, "these success fees, our evidence reveals that this would've been the fees paid based on some of the official work that Mr Motsoeneng would have done in, call it negotiating or arranging contracts with Multichoice. In our view, those success fees have been paid irregularly to Mr Motsoeneng."
The investigative body said the millions must be returned to the SABC.
The unit is working with the National Prosecuting Authority.
Mothibi said, "in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, there is a process at the end of every matter where the court could also recall that the accused person pay back the monies that have been lost in either fraud or any other criminal action."
The hope is that speedy conclusion of cases will help ease the financial crisis at the SABC.
