Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Healthcare practitioner and psychiatrist Dr. Lerato Dikobe-Kalane is calling for the inclusion of traditional healers in tackling mental health disorders. She says most of the country's psychiatrists are in private practice, and as a result, the majority of people with mental health disorders don't have access to treatment. Dikobe-Kalane says educating traditional healers about common mental health disorders and treatment options could make a significant impact.

Especially for the more milder conditions, things like maybe anxiety disorder or a mild depressive episode, my traditional healer colleague can pick that up and perhaps help", said Dikobe-Kalane. She says respect between both sectors needs to be established in order for the collaboration to work.
