US prop Eric Fry (C) takes part in the Captain's Run training session at Kobe Misaki Stadium in Kobe on September 25, 2019, on the eve of their Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool C match against England. SPONSORED England have a quick turnaround between fixtures with their second Rugby World Cup clash taking place just four days from their opener. They run out against the USA in Kobe City on Thursday. They did it comfortably against Tonga and they are expected to do the same against the Americans who face a tough task in their first match of the tournament. It’s reflected in the 1/100 on England and 40/1 on Canada in the Full Time Result market. You’re going to have to look at the spreads to try and get a tidy profit from this encounter. On the Handicap, England (-34.5) vs USA (+34.5) is at 9/10 and there is evens on England (-35.5) vs USA (+33.5). When it comes to Winning Margin, England over 12.5 is at 1/12, England under 12.5 at 7/1 and there are big prices on USA under 12.5, 45/1, and USA over 12.5 at 80/1. The Winning Margin Spread has England 31-35 priced at 11/2 and you can have the same price on England 36-40. England 26-30 is 13/2 and England 41-45 is at 7/1. These two sides haven’t met since 2007 but England have prevailed in the five encounters so far. The smallest winning margin was 18 points, the last time they met, but in other games the difference has been 28 points (twice), 29 points and a whopping 98 points when England whipped the USA 106-8 at Twickenham in 1999. England by 21-25 points is available at 8/1 and if you are looking at going bigger than that then you can get 17/2 on England 46-50 or 12/1 on England 51-55. If you are a fan of simple yes or no bets, there’s 28/10 if you decide no when it comes to the first try being converted or 2/7 on yes. There is 4/6 on the second half being the Highest Scoring Half, a probability as the USA run out of steam and you can have 12/10 if you think the first half will see the most points scored. This is a fixture that should be straight forward and England should keep marching on through Pool C, one that won’t cause them too many problems as far as advancing in the tournament. They are now looking to assert dominance and prove their credentials as a possible World Cup winning side. For all match betting click HERE
