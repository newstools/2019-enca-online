Molelekoa crashed his vehicle into a house after midnight on Wednesday, allegedly while drunk. “A vehicle, a Jeep, collided with two houses in Osizweni, it’s the neighbours, in one the houses a 31-year-old man, was injured on the head and rushed to the hospital, in ICU,” said police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele. Molelekoa is believed to be the driver of the Jeep. READ: Volvo to add in-car sensors to prevent drunk driving He was appointed just two weeks ago. But how could Molelekoa have lost control of the SUV in a residential area? “They discovered that he was drunk and was driving the vehicle drunk and then a case of drunken driving as well as reckless and negligent driving causing injuries has been opened for investigation so there is a procedure that is followed in drunken driving cases," Mbele said. KwaZulu-Natal’s Cooperative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka is calling for an investigation into the incident. However, Hlomuka also says it would be premature to jump to conclusions.
