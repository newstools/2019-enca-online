JOHANNESBURG - The South African Broadcasting Corporation has suspended three permanent employees and unscheduled one freelancer following the airing of the wrong clip of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech. The suspensions come after an incorrect address in which President Ramaphosa made mistakes and requested to start again was played on air. Ramaphosa's address focused on the current xenophobia and violence-against-women protests across the country. In a statement released on Tuesday, the public broadcaster described the error as an 'act of sabotage.' READ: Social media lukewarm after Ramaphosa address "Those involved in production activities were all warned in advance that they should disregard the rehearsal clip. The SABC now has strong prima facie evidence indicating that the broadcast of the incorrect clip was a well-considered and coordinated act of sabotage to bring the SABC and consequently the President into disrepute", read the statement. The public broadcaster says the second phase of the investigation into this incident is still underway.
