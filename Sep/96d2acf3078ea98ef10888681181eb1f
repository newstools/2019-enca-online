AfriForum's head of policy Ernst Roets. JOHANNESBURG - The South Gauteng High Court will make its ruling on contempt of court charges against Afriforum's Ernst Roets. The Nelson Mandela Foundation laid charges against him for tweeting a picture of South Africa's old flag, shortly after the Equality Court had ruled its gratuitous display constitutes hate speech. WATCH: AfriForum's Roets: 'Meaning of Apartheid flag has changed' In his tweet, Roets captioned the picture with a question asking whether he had just committed hate speech. He argues the tweet was part of his PHD research and had nothing to do with Afriforum.
