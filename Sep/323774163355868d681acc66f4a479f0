Police say a group of men in a minibus opened fire on a couple who'd gone to collect their child after a school trip. 12-year-old Rethabile Raphuleng and her grandfather were shot. The man died on the scene while the girl was hit by a stray bullet and died early on Thursday morning. READ: Lesufi calls for calm in Katlehong Lesufi has called on police to arrest the perpetrators within the next 72-hours. “We want to call on police, which is their task and mandate to hunt these criminals, we want to urge them to release the 72-hour call that they normally release to have these people arrested within the next 72-hours,” Lesufi said. “Because if you can’t arrest them, we risk rendering our country as a lawless institution that anyone can wish.” According to the child’s aunt, Zanele Molefe, the little girl was shot in the head and taken to a Germiston hospital using a neighbour’s vehicle. There have been allegations that the shooting could be due to a taxi industry feud. A grade 6 pupil has been killed in a shooting outside a primary school in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni.
