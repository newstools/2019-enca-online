Courtesy of #DSTV403 JOHANNESBURG - Activists are calling for the prioritization of gender-based violence crimes. As the prevalence of rape and femicide continues to grow, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he will call on Parliament to reconsider some laws to keep women safe. Jacqueline Hoorn from Human Rights and Justice NGO Nicro in the Western Cape said no parole for offenders cannot be the only answer to the problem.

What we need to do is encourage our criminal justice system to prioritize these cases so that the accused can be sentenced and start the intervention that is needed", said Hoorn. Hoorn said rehabilitation programmes provided in correctional facilities give the offender a chance to make amends with the victim and their family. "There are a lot of interventions in order to help the accused, the offender. To really look at, where did it go wrong and what can they do and put in place to make amends? But they have to start with themselves and making amends with their families, victims and society at large", added Hoorn.
