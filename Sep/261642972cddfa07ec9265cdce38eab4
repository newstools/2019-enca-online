The latest case involves a man who worked at Tongaat Secondary School. He was suspended last week over sexual misconduct allegations. Police are investigating a case of rape but the teacher hasn't been charged. It comes days after a 51-year-old Melmoth teacher was arrested for allegedly raping and impregnating a 13-year-old girl at Sinqobile High School. Questions have been raised as to how men like these are making their way into the school system?

I have not been advised of any case where we blatantly recruited or employed an offender. “If you know that you have been involved in sexual relations with learners and if you are tempted to even get into further relations with learners we are coming for you as a department. “We don’t have spaces for paedophiles in our schools. But we also saying to parents, partner with us, as we deal with these cases we must also open criminal charges so we send a clear message that our young learners, our young girls, are not subjects of abuse.” The investigations into both cases are expected to be finalised within 60 days.
