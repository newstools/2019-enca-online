Eben Etzebeth of South Africa during the 2019 Springbok Squad Announcement at Ulwazi Centre MultiChoice City, Johannesburg, on 26 August 2019 JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's rugby body promised to cooperate fully with investigations after star lock Eben Etzebeth denied assaulting and racially abusing a homeless man in the build-up to the World Cup. SA Rugby said it "will not tolerate acts of violence or racial abuse" and will take "appropriate action" once the investigation and legal process have unfolded. "As good and law-abiding corporate citizens, SA Rugby have given our full cooperation in the Eben Etzebeth investigation and will continue to do so," a statement said. "We stand by our earlier comments that we will not tolerate acts of violence or racial abuse. SA Rugby will take appropriate action once the legal investigation and process have concluded," it added.

Etzebeth, 27, was named in South Africa's squad just a day after allegations on social media that he insulted, assaulted and pointed a gun at a homeless man. The 78-cap lock was interviewed by Human Rights Commission officials before flying out with the rest of the South African squad, who are among the favourites to win the World Cup in Japan. "It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone as has been reported on social media," the 27-year-old said last month in a statement.
