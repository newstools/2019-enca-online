Ramaphosa has thrown his weight around Friday’s Sandton shutdown march at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Hundreds of people protested against gender-based violence in Sandton, Johannesburg. The recent spate of violence against women and children has shaken the country. WATCH: Ramaphosa vows to intensify fight against drugs Civil society organisations and activists are calling for an end to the violence. "We support their cause and we are going to reinvigorate our commitment to make sure our country takes a really strong stance against gender-based violence,” Ramaphosa said. “Even in this community there are people who have been killed by men who say they love them have killed those women and it is about time that our whole country and nation should take a firm stance. “We will announce interventions that we think everybody should make, government, the private sector, communities, various associations in our communities. This for us is very important."
