File: Former NPA deputy prosecutions boss, Nomgcobo Jiba JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa’s legal team has described Nomgcobo Jiba’s attempt to be reinstated as an NPA deputy director as premature and unnecessary. In April, Ramaphosa fired Jiba and senior prosecutor Lawrence Mrwebi after retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro recommended he sack them from the NPA. On Thursday, Jiba's legal representatives argued that she faced ongoing harm from Ramaphosa’s decision to cut her salary. UPDATE: Temporary reprieve for Nomgcobo Jiba Jiba maintains the President was incorrect to appoint a commission of inquiry into her fitness to hold office and says she wants to continue to receive her full pay and benefits. Last month, Jiba successfully stopped Parliament from deciding on her reinstatement until the court has reviewed the Mokgoro Inquiry. Judgment in the case has been reserved.
