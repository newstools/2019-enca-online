File: This is a must-win encounter for Scotland if they are to have any hope while Samoa might be giving themselves a chance if they come out on top. [SPONSORED] It’s a match that will likely probably seal the fate of the losing side as Scotland clash with Samoa in Kobe City. Pool A was essentially blown wide open on the weekend as Japan sprung a major shock by defeating Ireland and while those two sides should still progress through it does change the complexion of the group slightly. It makes this a must-win encounter for Scotland if they are to have any hope while Samoa might be giving themselves a chance if they come out on top. Looking at the betting markets, Scotland are 1/8 favourites for the encounter while their Southern Hemisphere opposition are 6/1. On the Handicap, Scotland (-16.5) vs Samoa (+16.5) can be taken at 9/10 either way. Or there’s evens on Scotland (-17.5) vs Samoa (+15.5). Samoa will be angry after the bans incurred on two players for dangerous tackles. They’ll be fired up for it too with Scotland’s coach getting involved in comments in the build-up around the discipline of the Samoans. Scotland have made five changes to this the match day squad that lost in their opener. Looking at the history between these sides it would appear that Scotland might have to work very hard here. They’ve won four of the of the last five Tests played but they haven’t done it too convincingly with only a few points separating the two. Scotland are also under pressure to earn bonus points. The Alternative Winning Margin has Scotland 11-20 at 28/10 and 33/10 on Scotland 1/10 and the same price on Scotland 21-30. Can they win by that much? Hard to be confident given recent form however the first two options are tempting. Samoa 1-10 is offered at 7/1. The Wining Margin Spread has Scotland 16-20 at 5/1 and Scotland 11-15 or Scotland 21-25 at 11-2. Scotland 6-10 is at 6/1 while Samoa 1-5 is at 7/1. Scotland over 12.5 is at 6/10 on the Winning Margin market and Scotland under 12.5 is at 21/10. Samoa under 12.5 is at 13/2 and Samoa over 12.5 is at 18/1. Darcy Graham and Sean Maitland are favourites to be the first tryscorer at 7/1 while Stuart Hogg is at 17/2. Ed Fidow is the first Samoan player to feature in this market, offered at 16/1 to cross the whitewash first. You can get 2/1 on the same player scoring a try at any time during the match. The Halftime/Fulltime book has Scotland to win both halves at 7/20 and you can get 9/2 on Samoa having the lead at the break and the Scots coming from behind. Think Samoa might dominate proceedings? You can have 7/1 to back up that theory if they lead at both halftime and fulltime. This should be an interesting contest, definitely something to distract from the fact that it’s a Monday.
