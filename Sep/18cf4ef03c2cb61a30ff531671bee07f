"The first one was last year,Â we weren't really sure what the demand was going to be, and we were overwhelmed. And I think this year equally so. It's an interesting industry it's an environment where anyone can come, they can dress up as their favourite superhero, they feel safe, they with likeminded people, and at the end of the day, they dressing up and making their own costumes."
Although cosplay is one of the highlights of comic con, the industry as a whole is gaining traction here at home.
Comic-Con Africa runs until Tuesday.
