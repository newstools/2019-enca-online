The paper is reporting that Maimane declared he owns the house but it has since emerged that he does not own the property. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said the matter would be clarified in the weeks ahead. READ: MPs come with hefty price tag "I can say very clearly here what Mr Maimane is guilty of is over declaration, rented properties are not required to be declared in the declaration of interest but in any event the apparent owner of the property is listed under Mr Maimane's benefit," Steenhuisen said. So I think what you have got here is the case of over declaration rather than under-declaration but obviously the matter will be clarified in the weeks ahead," he said.
