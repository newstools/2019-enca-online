Nzimande says a shocking number of men serving life sentences have committed gender-based violence.
"We have done well in focusing on the girl child, like the campaign take a girl child to work. But the SACP is saying now it's also time to give equal attention to the boy child as well.Â If you go to your nearest prison, 90% of the prisoners are young African men and you'll find at least 60% of them who are serving life sentences are there for gender-based violence."
