A crippling strike at all government mortuaries in KwaZulu-Natal is not off the table - yet. That's the word from the Public and Allied Workers Union of South Africa, Pawusa. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A crippling strike at all government mortuaries in KwaZulu-Natal is not off the table - yet. That's the word from the Public and Allied Workers Union of South Africa, Pawusa. The union is set to meet with provincial health authorities on Monday over worker conditions. WATCH: Bodies pile up in Cape Town's mortuaries Employees at Durban's Gale Street mortuary embarked on an illegal strike this week causing a frustrating backlog. They are complaining about the re-reinstatement of a manager suspended in 2016. Employees had complained about her management style and alleged misconduct. Pawusa KZN Secretary Halalisani Gumede says, "The workers were not comfortable to see her here because many issues are revolving around her." WATCH: New forensics mortuary expected to alleviate backlog KZN Health HOD Sandile Shabalala added that the Health Department didn’t find any wrongdoing by the said manager. Health authorities also promise all affected families will be able to bury their loved ones this weekend. Despite things going back to normal this week, the union says next week could be different. Health authorities claim they have contingency plans should the strike continue at Gale Street.
