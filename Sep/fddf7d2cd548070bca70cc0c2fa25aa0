The power utility's however admitted that the system remains vulnerable. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance says it has received reliable information there'll be rolling blackouts in September and October. DA MP Natasha Mazzone, says on the party's website, that Eskom apparently issued warnings of the impending blackouts to municipalities. The DA has written to Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza to clarify the matter. WATCH: Eskom absolute liars, Stage 5 already implemented: Energy expert Energy expert Ted Blom said the primary reason for load-shedding is a shortage of coal. “There is still a severe shortage of coal at Eskom. They put out a tender about two weeks ago for another 400 odd million tonnes of coal and in total, they need more than 900 million tonnes of coal and that's equal to one power station's consumption over 40-years,” said Blom. Eskom has declined to comment. The utility has reiterated its commitment to ensuring power stability whilst urging consumers to use electricity sparingly.
