"It’s very tough on Trevor," Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus said. "He has had a great season and added value whenever he took the field. "It’s a blow to him and the team, but it’s also an opportunity for Thomas and Vincent (Koch), who now have the chance to step up." Du Toit had signed a short-term deal to play for French Top 14 side Toulouse during the World Cup but is now expected to link up with the Bok squad at their training base in Nagoya on Tuesday afternoon.
