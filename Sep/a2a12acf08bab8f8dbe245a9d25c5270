NEW YORK - Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr's trial over accusations he groped a woman in New York was adjourned until next month after prosecutors asked for more time to prepare their case.

Gooding's lawyer Mark Heller told reporters after the short hearing that he was extremely confident the case would be dismissed, describing the allegations as "totally unfounded."
