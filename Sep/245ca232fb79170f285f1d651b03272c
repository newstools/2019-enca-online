Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - There's been no sign of the Great white shark in False Bay. Cape Town researchers say this may be due to climate change. On average, there's been over two hundred shark sightings a year- but this year no sharks have been spotted. WATCH: The great white mystery in False Bay Shark Spotters CEO Sarah Waries believes the sharks have moved further up the east coast due to orcas or environmental conditions. "There seems to be a shift eastwards, so that is why there has been an increase in activity in the Mossel Bay and Algoa Bay area. So it could be for some reasons whether its orcas or environmental conditions the sharks have appeared to have moved further up the east coast and not use the False Bay area.'' 
Waries adds that businesses dependent on shark sightings are also feeling the pinch. READ: Are sharks being attacked by killer whales off Cape Town's coast? "Economically also there's a lot of people who rely on the sharks, the cage industry in False Bay has historically been very big and they have struggled with a lack of shark sittings" The last time a shark was spotted here in False Bay was back in April.
