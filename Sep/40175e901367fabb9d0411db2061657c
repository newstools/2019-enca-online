JOHANNESBURG - Two embryos of northern white rhinos have been successfully fertilised in an Italian laboratory. This is being seen as a step towards saving the functionally extinct species. Najin and Fatu are the only two remaining northern white rhinos on earth. They're currently under 24-hour guard at a conservancy in Kenya.

Last month scientists and conservationists from Italy, Germany and the Czech Republic successfully harvested 10 eggs from Najin and Fatu. After 10 days, two embryos were created. Fatu's keeper, Zachariah Mutai, has been fighting to prevent this endangered species from going completely extinct.

So we need to put more effort on that. We need collaboration of all people to make sure these animals they are not going to go extinct at some point.” The two precious embryos are now being preserved in liquid nitrogen. They will be transferred into female southern white rhinos for surrogacy in the near future.
