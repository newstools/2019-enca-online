Why is the City of Tshwane's head of emergency services still earning a salary, after the Auditor-General recommended he be fired? Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in Tshwane wants the Gauteng government to instruct the municipality to fire City of Tshwane's head of emergency services Previn Govender. Govender does not have the qualifications for the job. The Auditor-General wants him to be fired because his position requires a Bachelor's Degree and he has a diploma.
Last year, the South African Qualifications Authority labelled former city manager Moeketsi Mosola a liar when he said the institution had given that diploma a thumbs up. READ: Lying on your CV could mean jail time Govender, who’s now being investigated for alleged fraud and tender-rigging by police, declined to comment. The ANC is accusing the DA of protecting Govender at all costs. The Auditor-General also wants former chief of staff in the mayor’s office, Marietha Aucump, to pay up after she lied that she had a B.Tech Degree.
