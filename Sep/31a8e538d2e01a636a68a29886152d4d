Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Everyone from the South African Police Service top brass to the National Prosecuting Authority tried to shield former spy boss Richard Mdluli from prosecution. For the third day, senior Hawks investigator Kobus Roelofse told the state capture inquiry his investigations into Mdluli were stalled and obstructed from the start. Roelofse, who often interacted with prosecutors during his time in the now-disbanded Scorpions, says he couldn't believe the NPA's decision to drop Mdluli's case. "When the decision was taken and the reasons advanced for that decision did not make sense," Roelofse said.

"General Mdluli set in motion a drive to identify those Criminal Intelligence members who had assisted me in the investigation,” Roelofse said. “The result thereof is that more than 20 members of Crime Intelligence were transferred within days after his reappointment." To finalise numerous investigations, Roelofse needed documents declassified. He said then-Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega and the current police chief, Khehla Sitole, have offered no help.

"He also referred to senior management,” Roelofse said. “His own management that does not want to assist him, or want to allow him to assist us." A former Crime Intelligence official, now under witness protection, is expected on the stand on Friday.
