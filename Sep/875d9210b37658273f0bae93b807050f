"We're all gutted for Scott," Jackson told the RNZ website in Auckland. "He was playing some good rugby. But we all understand that this is the nature of our game. So we need to push forward to Japan. "And that's why we've brought Cowley into our squad. He spent the PNC with us and so he's familiar with the playing group and how we want to play the game."

"It's an unfortunate circumstance in which to be called up. I feel for Scotty," Cowley said. "I know what it's like because the same thing happened to me in 2015 when I did my AC joint in the last game of the PNC against Canada which ruled me out of the World Cup." Samoa, World Cup quarter-finalists in 1991 and 1995, kick off their campaign against Russia in Kumagaya on September 24, before facing against Scotland, Japan and Ireland.
