WATCH: Maditla to be sentenced for murder of 4 Judge Sheila Mphahlele said, “due to the seriousness of this case the personal circumstances of the accuse will recede to the background. Emphasis will be on retribution and deterence.” The judge said she could not find any reason to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence. Judge Mphahlele said, “the most aggravating factor is that the perpetrator is the mother. Their mother was meant to nurture and protect them. These innocent children were the victims of the fights she had with Shongwe. She betrayed her own children.” Maditla has previously said she deserves a life sentence for her crime. Madilta's family said after the sentencing that they have forgiven her, they would always love her.
