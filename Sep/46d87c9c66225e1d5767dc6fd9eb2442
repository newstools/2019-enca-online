Operation Lockdown aimed to help the police patrol areas and reduce crime in the city's gang-infested areas. A spate of murders forced authorities to send in the army to support the police. Western Cape Safety MEC Albert Fritz has acknowledged the army's presence is making a difference. Bonteheuwel Community Activist Henriette Abrahams says she does not think the army's presence has been very effective in reducing the crime in the Cape Flats. "There is a war going on, everywhere. In Hanover Park Mannenberg, Delph. It did not bring the crime down, while people are dying." eNCA's Nobesuthu Rejana is in Nyanga. #DStv403
