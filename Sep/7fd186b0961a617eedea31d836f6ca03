File: Hlaudi Motsoeneng's meteoric rise at the SABC and hefty salary increases made headlines until he was fired in 2017. JOHANNESBURG - Former SABC board chairperson Ben Ngubane, on Monday said Hlaudi Motsoeneng not having a Matric certificate was never an issue. Ngubane appeared before the State Capture Inquiry on Monday and said that the self-proclaimed “organic intellectual” was the right person to occupy the chief operations officer position. In a scathing 2014 report, the Public Protector found Motsoeneng to be a fraud, who should never have been employed at the SABC in the first place. WATCH: State capture inquiry continues His meteoric rise at the SABC and hefty salary increases made headlines until he was fired in 2017. “We knew that a matric certificate and higher qualifications are always required but, like the people in the Free State, they were dealing with a crisis where the people who were there that were supposed to deliver a successful broadcast service were failing." "Hence, they took this boy who did not have a matric and he made a difference", said Ngubane. On Tuesday, the commission will hear testimonies from Anton Van Vuuren and Hlaudi Motsoeneng.
