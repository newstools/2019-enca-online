Many Nigerian nationals have been camping outside the consulate in Sandton after being promised free evacuation back home. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - A young mother, sleeping at the Nigerian Consulate with her child, says she has no choice but to try to go back to her home country. She's among a number of Nigerian nationals who have fled their South African homes to safety, amidst attacks on foreign nationals. Earlier this week, a number of Nigerians flew home on a flight organised by their government. A second flight, scheduled to take off on Thursday, saw a number of delays. It's unclear when the next flight to Nigeria will take off.
