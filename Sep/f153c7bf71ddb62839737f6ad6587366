The clashes triggered a diplomatic rift between South Africa and other countries. Nigerian Consul-General Godwin Adama said another group of Nigerians have returned home after the first group left for Lagos last week.

Of course going from what happened recently in the xenophobic attacks, some of them have lost their property and they felt they could not continue to stay", said Adama. Violence that led to looting and destruction of property rocked Johannesburg and surrounding areas leading to the deaths of 12 people, two of whom were foreign nationals.
