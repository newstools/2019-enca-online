Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Judge Roland Sutherland from the South Gauteng High Court has declared the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act (Rica) unlawful. News 24's Investigative Unit Amabhungane went to court after learning that its managing partner, Sam Sole, had been the target of state surveillance under Rica.
