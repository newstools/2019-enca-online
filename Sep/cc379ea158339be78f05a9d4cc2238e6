Then, just a few steps away, the couple visited the District 6 Homecoming Centre. The Duke and Duchess joined a community cooking activity and that showcased food which reflected the diversity of the area.
They mixed freely with the community, tasted some of the food and asked about the ingredients.
The couple will have another busy day celebrating Heritage Day in the Book Kaap.
