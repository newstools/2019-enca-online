Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Public Protector says opponents may be trying to bankrupt her – to get her out of office. Busisiwe Mkhwebane hit back at detractors, in a politically charged speech to Unisa law students on Tuesday. She says judicial reviews of her reports are being weaponised to measure her competence. WATCH: DA warned getting rid of Mkhwebane won't be an easy task “Whereas ordinarily the review, like an appeal, is an opportunity for an aggrieved party to approach another form... But unfortunately it is currently being used as a weapon or as a yardstick to measure the competence of the public protector.” She says personal costs orders handed down against her may be part of a strategy to force her out of office. “It’s difficult to remove the Public Protector so the only way is to bankrupt her, and make her unfit to hold that office. Possibly that's the way that it’s being done, using the courts to do that. But all I can say is that I will continue doing my work without fear or favour, and if I perish, I perish,” she said.
