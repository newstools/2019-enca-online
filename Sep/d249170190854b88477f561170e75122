"The conduct displayed by the driver is not only reckless but also smacks of arrogance," said the department's spokesperson Ofentse Morwane. "With the province experiencing a high number of unnecessary crashes and fatalities on our roads, it is of utmost importance that our law enforcement agencies should stamp their authority on those who disregard the rules of the road. Morwane said drivers should also respect authorities. "The conduct of the driver in question is punishable at all costs and will never be allowed. Irrespective of the attitude of road users, we will continue to stamp our authority and do our work without fear and favour."
