Indian actress and model Priyanka Chopra (L) and US singer songwriter Nick Jonas arrive for the screening of the film "The Best Years of a Life . LOS ANGELES - Actress Priyanka Chopra and her pop star husband Nick Jonas were named the best dressed of 2019 by People magazine, marking the first time in the celebrity magazine's history that a couple has shared top style honours. Chopra, a former Miss World who became a star in both Hollywood and Bollywood, and Jonas topped People's annual best-dressed list in an eclectic slate that included actor Billy Porter and tennis champion Serena Williams along with style-setting veterans such as Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Celine Dion. "It's the first time ever that we have had a man or a couple on the Top 10 list, let alone as the best dressed. But it really felt like these two deserved it," People's style and beauty director, Andrea Lavinthal, told Reuters. "The combination of the two of them is so exciting to watch. (Jonas) is not exactly someone who just wears a black tuxedo and stands next to her on the red carpet. You can tell that he enjoys fashion as much as she does," Lavinthal added. Chopra, who became the first Indian to headline a US television drama series as the star of "Quantico," married the younger of the three Jonas Brothers musicians in New Delhi in December 2018, becoming one of the most sought-after celebrity couples in the world. Lavinthal praised Chopra and Jonas for embracing different styles and designers but always looking good. "They don't do matchy-matchy but they still look like they go together," she said. "Even walking down the street in New York City, they are not in jeans and a T-shirt or casual pants. She is in a head to toe look, and so is he."
