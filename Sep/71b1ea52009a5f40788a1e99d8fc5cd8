India's cricket team captain Virat Kohli (L) and South Africa's Quinton de Kock arrive on the field for the toss before the start of the second Twenty20 international cricket match at Punjab Cricket Association Stadium in Mohali on September 18, 2019. CHANDIGARH - India skipper Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bowl first in the second Twenty20 international against South Africa in Chandigarh on Wednesday. Both the teams are looking to go one-up in the three-match series after the first game was washed out without a ball being bowled in Dharamsala on Sunday. "It's a great chasing ground, any kind of dew makes it very difficult in the second half, we've experienced that in the past," Kohli said at the toss. South Africa's new T20 captain, Quinton de Kock, said the senior members in the team will pass on their experience of playing in India to the newcomers. "Captaincy is a new experience for me and I'm thoroughly enjoying it," said de Kock.
