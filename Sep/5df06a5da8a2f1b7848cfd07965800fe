Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Convicted drug mule Nolubabalo "Babsie" Nobanda claims she was lured into trafficking drugs by a promise of an all-expense-paid holiday to Brazil. Nobanda says she had no clue her final destination would be Thailand. “There was no mention of Thailand when I left South Africa, we were taking a holiday to Brazil,” Nobanda said. She says it’s only when she arrived in Brazil that she found out that she would be transporting a package to Thailand.

"It's a chance for others to understand where they can go wrong, what to avoid," she said. "I want my life to be about, don't be like Babsie, watch out. Don't be so naive," Nobanda said. Nobanda also stated she would be starting in her own community, empowering people with information on how to avoid making the same mistakes.
