Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Accountability Now has launched an urgent bid to declare Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane unfit to hold office. The civil society organisation cited several court findings against Mkhwebane as the reason they believe she is not fit to head the Chapter Nine institution. READ: Accountability Now calls for Malunga to investigate Mkhwebane "We are concerned about the lack of urgency with which the government, the Parliamentarians, the President and indeed the criminal justice system and the legal practice council are approaching this matter. We see the public protector swinging about like a wrecking ball", said Accountability Now's Paul Hoffman. The matter is provisionally set to be heard on 22 October at the Pretoria high court.
