Springbok captain Siya Kolisi has not captained the side since 2018 due to his injury. JOHANNESBURG – Springbok coach Rassies Erasmus has named a formidable 23-man squad for the Rugby World Cup warm-up match against Japan on Friday. It will be a milestone for SA Rugby's Player of the Year Pieter-Steph du Toit, who will earn his 50th cap. Du Toit has been a pivotal part of the team since making his international debut in November 2013.

Kolisi is the only change to the team that drew with the All Blacks in Wellington. He replaces Kwagga Smith, who drops out of the matchday 23 altogether, in what has become an otherwise settled combination. There are 18 changes to the team which defeated Argentina, 26-24 at Loftus just over a week ago. The only survivors of that match, along with Kolisi, are RG Snyman and Jesse Kriel, both of whom move to the bench along with Frans Steyn, who covers several positions in the backline.

They won six of nine matches played in 2018, which saw them climb the rankings to equal their highest place ever position of ninth. Kick-off is at 12h15 SA time.
