All because of the way she looked. Now, a new production at the Market Theatre explores the life of Sarah Baartman, the so-called Hottentot Venus. "Venus Vs Modernity" has received rave reviews, with audience members calling it empowering. WATCH: Sarah Baartman's story to be told in a Hollywood film In the early 1800s, Sarah Baartman, a Khoi woman, was taken from her home to become a slave in the Cape Colony. She was later taken to London and paraded as part of a freak show because of her pronounced bodily features. Poet Lebo Mashile says, "She (Baartman) endured horrific abuse while she was in Europe. She ultimately died at the age of 25 in Paris. Her body was dissected by a scientist in France. He picked her brains, her genitals and her body parts were put on display for 150 years at a French National Museum."
Through poetry, the spoken word and music, her story is given a modern spin.
Mashile adds says the story is especially relevant to black women today.
This production is on at the Market Theatre until Sunday. It will then travel to Holland for the Afrovibes Festival.
