The stretch of road between the Crown Interchange and Maritzburg Street has been closed since February in order to repair an unstable bridge. The agency says the rehabilitation will cost more than the R160-million budgeted.

We have had a few delays that have added to the additional costs. So at the moment we are sitting at about R180-R165-million and the project is not complete as yet", said Infrastructure Development HOD Siya Genu. The JRA has promised to complete renovation of the M2 bridge by the end of October.
