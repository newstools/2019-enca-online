#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department has condemned an incident in which the newly renamed Rietondale High School was vandalised over the weekend. The school, formerly known as Hoërskool Hendrik Verwoerd, was renamed in August as part of the department's efforts to rid schools of apartheid-era names and symbols. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said that not only had a wall baring the school's new name been vandalised, but there were also other incidents including the theft of taps and shower heads and the vandalism of the llapa on the school property. MEC Panyaza Lesufi condemned the vandalism. "This act against the school is a violation of a fundamental human right and undermines our transformation agenda. This act will not deter us from our agenda of transforming the education system. "We strongly condemn any acts of criminality and the disruption of schooling, which seek to undermine the dignity of both learners and educators." A case of vandalism had been opened with the police.
