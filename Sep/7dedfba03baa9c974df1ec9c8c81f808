Sandile Ndlovu remains critical in hospital and on life support after being reportedly attacked in a lecturing at DUT. JOHANNESBURG - Protesting DUT students are calling for a shutdown of the institution after industrial engineering student Sandile Ndlovu was reportedly stabbed in the head in a lecturing hall on campus. Ndlovu is currently in an intensive care unit at Durban's City Hospital, where he is on life support due to extensive brain damage. Students have blocked entrances to the university and are calling for answers from the institution. UPDATE: Themane murder case postponed "As you can see, all the gates are being closed and the campus is shut down. The reason for that is because students are angry and are not feeling safe anymore. One student has been stabbed in the classroom, he was just studying and no one has been accountable for that", said DUT SRC President Thamsanqa Memela. The institution confirmed that the incident happened and said an investigation is underway to determine what lead to the attack. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted murder has been opened. No arrests have been made.
