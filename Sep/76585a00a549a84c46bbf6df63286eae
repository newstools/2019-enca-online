CAPE TOWN - Students and UCT staff are gathering on Wednesday to remember murdered student Uyinene Mrwetyana. A day of mourning has been declared as the university comes together against sexual and gender-based violence. Students have been protesting over security issues and have vowed to shut down the institution if their demands are not met. They have given the university a deadline to respond to their demand. Angry Khayelitsha residents torched the house of Mrwetyana's alleged killer on Tuesday night. The post office employee is accused of raping and killing the UCT student.
