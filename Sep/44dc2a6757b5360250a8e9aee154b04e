Veteran trail runner Christiaan Greyling has taken on the monumental challenge of summiting seven mountains in seven days - all in aid of a tremendous cause. He's summiting seven mountains in seven days to raise money for young children with disabilities, who may never be able to do the same.

All the funds will go to the Lonwabo Project. It's for a school in Emfuleni," said Geyling.
