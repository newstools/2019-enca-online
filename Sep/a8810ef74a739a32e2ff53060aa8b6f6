It's many a woman’s worst nightmare to have her wig snatched off her head. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Wigs are a prized possession for many women but human hair can set you back thousands of rand. This makes wigs attractive to both entrepreneurs - and thieves. With millions of South Africans wearing headpieces, it's easy for thieves to target them in public. Wig theft is common but it often goes unreported, with victims feeling too humiliated to report the crime to the police. This is the kind of challenge that Gugulethu-based Khubar Hair and Beauty is trying to address. “Anything can happen at any time so it is a risk. But what is important is how you manage the risk,” said. “Managing the risk is when you sell it in your place of safety and ensure that the customer receives it in a safe place.” READ: Parents demand review of hair policy at CT school Thandeki and Khunjulwa Makaluza launched their business last year and already their venture has garnered interest from a renowned business school.

They want to create wide-ranging products for balding men, so that they too can hold their heads high.
