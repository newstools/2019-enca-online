That is why we don't even have 100% pass rate, they struggle when they get to the FET phase and that means there are deficits they have been carrying through the system and that is why some drop out", said Motshekga. Motshekga said the field trial for the general education certificate at the end of Grade 9 is scheduled for completion at the end of July 2020.
