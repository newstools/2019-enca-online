Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG – Police have arrested a fourth suspect in connection with the kidnapping of Amy'Leigh de Jager. The arrest comes following the arrest of three suspects just days after the six-year-old was kidnapped and found. Police arrested a 24-year-old man on Monday at Muvhango, an area just outside Vanderbijlpark. He will appear in court on Wednesday. “Following a long search, a fourth and possibly final suspect wanted in connection with the Amy’Leigh De Jager kidnapping was arrested earlier today,” police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Monday night. READ: Amy'Leigh kidnapped to 'save suspect's daughter' Last week Tharina Human, Laetitia Nel and Pieter Jacobus van Zyl appeared in court for bail application. They are accused of orchestrating de Jager's kidnapping outside of her school and trying to extort R2-million from the child's parents. The little girl was dropped off in the early hours of the following morning, unharmed, and reunited with her parents. Police said the state will request that the fourth suspect be remanded in custody until 1 October when he will reappear with the other three suspects for a formal bail application. “We are satisfied that we have all the people responsible for the kidnapping of Amy’Leigh behind bars and the possibility of more arrests being effected is very unlikely,” Naidoo said.
