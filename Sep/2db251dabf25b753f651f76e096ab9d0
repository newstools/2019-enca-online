File: Argentina's Guido Petti celebrates scoring a try during a match with the Springboks on 17 August 2019. SPONSORED The encounter between France and Argentina in their opening fixture of the Rugby World Cup is an interesting one. For starters, it is a game that will likely go a long way in deciding who finishes as runner’s up in Pool C. So it’s big pressure from the first whistle for both. The other reason that it seems to be so intriguing is that it involves two sides who are not always the most consistent. You’re not totally sure which side turns up on the day. And it’s reflected in the betting for this encounter with 17/20 available on France and 23/20 on offer on the South Americans getting the job done in the opener. On their day, the French know how to get the job done and this year they’ve run Wales close, beaten Scotland twice and Italy but they’ve also suffered defeat to Ireland and a heavy loss to England. Argentina on the other hand are winless all year having lost every single game in their Rugby Championship campaign. The two sides are also not exactly setting the world alight with regards to their world rankings with France hovering at 8th and Argentina in 11th in the current rankings. As for the history between the two sides, France have the upper hand having won 36 encounters, lost 14 with a solitary draw. In their most recent encounter, France won 28-13 in November last year. France are 12/10 won claim the Half Time/ Full Time double while Argentina are 19/10 to prevail in both. You can get 13/2 on France coming from behind at half time to win at the final whistle. Thinking of having a bet on the Half Time Result? There’s 5/6 on France ending on top after the first 40 minutes and even money on Argentina with 16/1 on the draw. The Winning Margin market has France Under 12.5 at 15/10 and Argentina under 12.5 at 22/0. There’s 33/10 on France over 12.5 and 5/1 on Argentina over 12.5. France are 8/10 to be the first team to score in the encounter with even money on Argentina doing the same. Looking at the Winning Margin Spread, France 1-5 is given at 4/1, France 6-10 at 9/2 and Argentina 1-5 at 11/2. Argentina 6-10 is at 7/1 and France 16-20 is at 17/2. It’s evident that this is likely to be a close fought contest but you’d think that the French would just hold too many guns for Argentina to be able to match them.
