Rapper AKA JOHANNESBURG - Recent violent protests in South Africa lead to some heated exchanges between celebrities on social media. Nigerian musician Burna Boy caused a stir on social media after saying he would boycott the country because his fellow Nigerians were being treated badly. He then tagged local rapper AKA in a series of tweets, telling him to beef up his security. "And @MI_Abaga it’s F**k @akaworldwide from now on. And if you down with him, it’s F**k you too. I respect you too much, please Don’t throw my respect out the window cuz I swear you will fly out with it", read one of his tweets. The exchange began after Nigerian rapper YCee accused AKA of fuelling the xenophobic tensions through tweets that were posted when South Africa lost in the Afcon quarter-finals to Nigeria. AKA has responded following the clash and asked for peace. "PLEASE!!! Can we STOP. We are going to make things worse for everybody on both sides. We need each other!  ... please. Can we stop. We are supposed to be leading our people", said AKA. Meanwhile, several other celebrities including Tiwa Savage and Sho Madjozi have also weighed in on the violent protests in the country.
