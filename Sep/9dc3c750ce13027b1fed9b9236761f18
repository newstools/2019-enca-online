Lulama Mokhobo told the state capture inquiry on Wednesday that disgraced former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng took her to the infamous mansion. It's there she says she was congratulated on her new job by the Guptas and Duduzane Zuma. She said when she got to the public broadcaster, there was no contract in place, whatsoever, between the SABC and the Guptas' TNA Media for the infamous TNA Business Breakfasts.

Initially, she said she saw great value in the proposition, as it was marketed as bringing the government to the people.
The former Group CEO said the SABC and TNA kept each other at arm's length about financial affairs. Mokhobo says she was shocked to find out the Guptas had found some way to make a profit out of it all.
The company was reportedly charging government departments and SOEs about R1,000 per person to attend the events.
