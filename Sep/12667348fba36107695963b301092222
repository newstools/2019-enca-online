 JOHANNESBURG - One of South Africa's top lawyers is causing a musical stir. Mzukisi Kota likes to raise his voice, but not when he's in court. Instead, he does it on stage. He performs in a choir at the Starlight Classics, a show that is packed with big names like Karen Zoid and Thembeka Mnguni. Kota says the law is actually quite musical. 'I'll be reading something and some word will trigger a connection to music. And then I have that tune stuck in my head. Even something in Latin will trigger something in my head.' "I often have to work with the office door closed because I find myself absently humming. Which is not always thrilling for the people in the office next door to me." * Watch Michael Marillier's story above.
