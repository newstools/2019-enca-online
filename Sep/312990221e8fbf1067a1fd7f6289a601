Courtesy #Dstv403 JOHANNESBURG - The CCMA says its caseload has increased substantially as a result of national minimum wage-related disputes. The initial expectation was a 10-percent spike since the introduction of the law at the beginning of the year. But, it seems many companies are still not complying and the Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi is talking tough. The CCMA received more than 100,000 complaints in the first half of the year. And referrals about the national minimum wage continue to increase. READ: Minimum wage comes into effect The commission's caseload has spiked by 12-percent. The minimum wage stipulates general workers should earn at least R20 per hour. But, Nxesi says many companies continue to flout the law. “I must be blunt when you talk middle and upper management the African and Coloured groups are under-represented. That shows lack of representation you’re talking about 60-67% still being white at those levels. If there’s no transformation, people are just protecting the privileges of the past.” Government says companies that refuse to comply, will be excluded from doing business with the state.
