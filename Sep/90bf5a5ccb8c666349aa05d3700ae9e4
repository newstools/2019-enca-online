Ouma Katrina Esau is the preserver of the Nlu language in the Northern Cape. Esau runs a school that teaches the San language to young people. Nlu is one of the endangered languages in South Africa. "I do this because I love the language," Esau said. WATCH: South Africa celebrates Heritage Day together The theme for this year's Heritage Day is about protecting our indigenous languages. The celebrations in Upington were, in true South African style, vibrant and full of energy. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africans are fortunate as a country to still have among us champions of our diverse cultures and languages. Ramaphosa says it's important that we embrace and celebrate all that we have, and not let it die. “Our languages are important, they define us," Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa is also encouraging each and every South African to learn another language, saying this is part of working together to create a better South Africa.
