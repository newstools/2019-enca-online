Namibia's back row Prince Gaoseb (R) passes the ball during a captain's run training session at the City of Toyota Stadium in Toyota City on September 27, 2019, on the eve of their Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool B match against South Africa. [SPONSORED] Expect tries. Lots of them. If the history between South Africa and Namibia is anything to go by then this is the perfect opportunity for the Springboks to fire in the tries when the two sides meet in a Pool B encounter on Saturday. Rassie Erasmus and his charges are still smarting after losing to the All Blacks in their Rugby World Cup opener last week and they’ll be raring to prove a point. They had after all taken the fight to New Zealand and had looked impressive in the first half before the game swung the other way. The full time result betting with the Springboks at 1/200 and Namibia at 100/1 is a clear indicator as to how this is going to play out. This is a fixture where the handicaps and margin spreads are the way to go. The handicap has South Africa (-58.5) vs Namibia (+58.5) at 9/10 with evens about the South Africa (-59.5) vs Namibia (+57.5). The Alternative Winning Margin has South Africa 51-60 at 3/1 and the same price on South Africa 61-70. There’s 4/1 on South Africa 41-50 and 71-80 is also offered at that price. South Africa by more than 80 points is at 9/1. That seems tempting when you consider that the Springboks won by 92 points and 87 points on the two previous occasions these sides met. The Springboks won 105-13 in Cape Town in 2007 and then 87-0 when they met in 2011. If you’re shouting for Namibia you may want to look away as this is probably going to be brutal. Namibia were downed 47-22 in their opener against Italy and the European opposition are generally used to being the whipping boys of the Six Nations. It does not bode well. As far as the First Stoppage In Play is concerned, there’s 14/10 on a line-out, 5/2 on a penalty or free kick and 28/10 on a scrum. You can have 6/1 on a try being scored to mark the first time play is halted for the encounter. One market that might be worth taking an interest in, especially with the promise of free flowing play and loads of tries being scored is picking the position of the player to score the first try. Take 15/10 on jersey number 11,14 or 15 and the same for any forward to cross the whitewash first. There’s 16/10 on jersey number 9,10,12 or 13. Will there be a drop goal? There’s 18/10 if you think so. We saw Handre Pollard slot one over against New Zealand. Perhaps Eton Jantjies will have a go too having earned a start at fly-half for this encounter.
