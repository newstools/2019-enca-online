News of a nationwide strike in the sector has been widely circulated. The union says, however, it is not aware of who made the strike call. Trucks blocked the N7 highway in the Western Cape and it affected traffic flow in the area. WATCH: Truck drivers living in fear Satawu says none of its members were involved. “It’s not our members. For about two weeks now there has been a message circulating saying that today there is going to be a strike if truck drivers didn’t participate then people would be hurt,” said Satawu’s Zanele Sabela. Sabela says that the union has no issues that they are dealing with. Trucks have blocked the N7 highway in the Western Cape. Courtesy #DStv403
