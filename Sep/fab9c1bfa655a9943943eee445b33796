Jeanette Cindi's sister has testified against the five men arrested for the crime at the South Gauteng High Court. “Her death and the way she passed on really hurt me because it was just the two of us," said Clowy Cindi. "We are orphans. It hurt me a lot because I often asked myself, ‘What kind of person does this to another human being?’ I even had a miscarriage during the course of this trial.” That’s the impact Jeanette Cindi’s murder has had on her sister. Cindi was five months pregnant when she was allegedly gang-raped before she and her friend, Lungelo Buthelezi, were assaulted and set alight in April 2017.

Clowy Cindi managed to speak to Jeanette shortly after the incident before she died. “She told me the accused forced Lungelo to kneel so he could watch while they rape her," Cindi said. "Her right hand was broken. She said they were assaulted by the men. I could tell that she had been burned because they put her underwear on her head. It looked like the underwear was burnt, then put on her head." Family members are hoping the justice system will provide them with closure, soon.
