Argentina's back row avier Ortega Desio (L) and hooker Agustin Creevy (R) take part in a captain's run training session at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium in Higashiosaka on September 27, 2019, on the eve of their Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool C match against Tonga. [SPONSORED] It’s a battle between the two teams rooted to the bottom of Pool C as Argentina and Tonga clash in their Rugby World Cup fixture on Saturday. Not it’s a bit harsh to refer to Argentina as one of the bottom of the table teams seeing as they were only just beaten by France by two points in their opener. However, the result now means that they are under serious pressure to try and have any hope of advancing out of the pool. They should have too much firepower for the Tongans to handle and it is reflected in the 1/33 on the Full Time Result. Tonga are 20/1 to get the victory. On the handicap, Argentina (-28.5) vs Tonga (+28.5) is at 9/10 and Argentina (-29.5) vs Tonga (+27.5) is at evens. Argentina to win both halves is at 1/1, the rest all double digits with Tonga to lead at half time but Argentina to bounce back at 10/1 and the unthinkable come from behind heroics for Tonga to win having been losing at half time is at 35/1. The Alternative Winning Margin market sees Argentina 21-30 and Argentina 31-40 at 33/10 and Argentina 11-20 at 7/2. Argentina 41-50 is 5/1 and Argentina 1-10 is at 6/1. These two sides met in the last edition of the Rugby World Cup with Argentina running out comfortable 45-16 winners. While the 29 point margin suggests it was very one-sided there was only seven points in it at half time on that occasion. If you are wanting to have a go on the exact winning margin then you can take 9/10 on Argentina winning by 30+ and 16/1 on Argentina by 29 if you feel they might replicate the result from the one and only meeting between these two teams. Looking at the Winning Margin Spread, Argentina 26-30 is at 11/2 as is Argentina 31-35. Argentina 21-25 is at 6/1 and you can have 13/2 on Argentina 36-40. The first time Tonga features in this market is the 33/1 offered on Tonga 1-5. While Argentina just failed to get over the line against France, Tonga were on the receiving end of a bruising defeat against England in their opening game and they’re likely to come out being very physical to start with before fizzling out as the game goes beyond the opening 20 minutes. Argentina are 3/10 to lead after 20 minutes and 1/50 to lead as the match goes past the hour mark. There’s also 9/10 available whether you decide to go odds or evens as far as the half time and Total Points markets go. Click HERE to view the full range of betting options for this match.
