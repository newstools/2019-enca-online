Courtesy #DStv403 HARARE - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the country must come out in numbers to honour his predecessor, Robert Mugabe. Mugabe's remains have arrived in the capital following his death in a Singapore hospital. Mugabe's wife, Grace, wearing a black veil, sat with Mnangagwa as a military band played a gospel song. "We are gathered here to receive our founding father of the nation.... an icon of Pan-Africanism, the man that created our nation," Mnangagwa said. "The light which led to independence is no more, but his works, his ideology will continue to guide this nation." Mugabe died on a medical trip to Singapore, where he had been travelling regularly for treatment.
