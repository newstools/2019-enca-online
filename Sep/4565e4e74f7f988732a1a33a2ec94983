Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Recently, Fourways Mall in Johannesburg North launched a new wing – making it one of the largest malls in Africa. After five years of construction, Fourways Mall finally reopened to shoppers late last month. More than 100 000 square metres of space across has been added to the centre, increasing its retail space to 178 000 square metres but many more new malls are being built. So, why is this happening when South Africa’s economy is showing minimal growth and facing bleak prospects? Developers say they're optimistic about the country’s future. “I think as a funder and developer it’s the believability," said Fourways Mall head of marketing Zoe Van Onselen. "If we don’t believe in the economy of the country we're only all going to head downwards. "The launch of this building for us is let’s move forward and have a belief in the country. We employ 4,000 people under this one building and we try to employ local, we have a large community that we feed”. READ: 'Rolex Gang' suspects arrested in Fourways What about promoting local? Some big malls highlight international, expensive brands. Fourways Mall management believes it’s on the right track with this. “What’s important to note is that what South Africa needs is the bigger retailers to collaborate with the smaller and local so that they can launch," Van Onselen said. "Edgars had a launch on Thursday and a local brand was showcased. "Inside Mr. Price has a coffee shop. Our bigger retailers are collaborating and we feel that that’s the best we can offer at the moment.” Last April, a Boeing 737 was transported from Jet Park to the Mall. It's part of KidZania, an interactive mega-city for kids combining inspiration, fun and learning through realistic role-play for children. Management says this part of the mall is expected to be functional later this year or early next year.
