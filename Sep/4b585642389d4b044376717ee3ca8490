Down Syndrome athletics meeting September running In all my 45 years of managing and streaming sport I have never encountered the humanness experienced at the Down Syndrome Athletics meeting held in Tshwane on 7 September - Apples Appleton I saw what should be rigid, impartial officials transform into coaches, motivating and applauding the athletes as they grappled with the technique of shot put, discus and javelin. Many of these athletes were first timers.
