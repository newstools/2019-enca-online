The pair have just returned from Switzerland where they competed against some of the world’s best. Zola Ngxakeni and Luyanda Thobigunya grew up in the Stellenbosch township of Khayamandi and mountain biking helped them rise above social ills and shape their destinies. “Mountain biking, means a lot to me. Also it changed my life. Because many young kids that are growing up in the streets, they using drugs, they end up going to jail. So I think I am safe with the bike,” said Thobigunya. Victory in the Exxaro Category of the Wine 2 Whales event earned the pair a trip to the Swiss Epic, their first international expedition. “It was amazing. Like stepping away to other countries and experiencing a culture and then Switzerland, it is a big country, cycling is very big there. The Swiss Epic was really amazing, it was a really hard race. We were above 2000m climbing every day so it was something new for us. It was an amazing experience. I really enjoyed it and I learnt a lot from it,” said Ngxakeni.
