Over 200 firefighters have been suspended and more than half of the city's fire stations don't have fire engines. EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says the City's fire engines are very old. WATCH: Joburg metro orders new fire engines amid shortage "The vehicles that we have, they are very much old. Some of them have been in the service for over 15, 20 years in the service. And you must understand these vehicles they run 24/7, 365 days in a year. So we took a longer period of time without replacing them so they are spending most of the time at the workshop repairing them" If a disaster were to strike, you're most likely to get fire engines from Midrand, Sandton, Alexandra, Berea, Rietfontein, Roodepoort, Dobsonville, Florida Park, Hunters Hill, Orange Farm, Cosmo City and Eldorado Park.
Just 12 fire stations of the City's 30. Mulaudzi suggests a possible announcement of a new fleet of 40 fire engines.
"The 40 ones are locally manufactured so of course this will be able to address the issues of repairs and maintenance because, with the current fleet that we have, most of these vehicles are imported, meaning that it takes a longer period of time to get parts."
The big announcement is expected early this week, to help extinguish some of the emergency services troubles.
